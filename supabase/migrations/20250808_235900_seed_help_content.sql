### What You''re Learning

**🧠 Mental Models**

**🎯 Goal Connection**
Every concept you see here was specifically chosen for your stated goal. This isn''t random education - it''s targeted growth.

### How to Learn Effectively

**📖 Read Actively**
Don''t just skim. Ask yourself:
- "How does this apply to my situation?"
- "When have I seen this pattern before?"
- "What would change if I used this thinking?"

**🤔 Make Connections**
Link new concepts to your existing knowledge and experiences. The stronger these connections, the better you''ll remember and use the material.

**📝 Take Notes** *(Optional)*
While not required, jotting down key insights can help retention.

### Key Content Elements

-- Plan Screen Help
('plan-screen-help', 
'## Turn Knowledge into Action

The **Plan** screen is where learning becomes living. Here, you''ll create specific, actionable plans to apply your new mental tools in real-world situations.

### Two Types of Plans

**🎯 Implementation Intentions (Mental Models)**
Concrete plans for how you''ll use a thinking framework:
- "When X situation occurs, I will use Y mental model"
- "In Z context, I will apply this decision-making tool"
- "During my morning routine, I will practice this thinking pattern"

**🕵️ Spotting Missions (Cognitive Biases)**  
Specific plans to notice and avoid thinking traps:
- "I will watch for this bias when making decisions about..."
- "In meetings, I''ll check whether this bias is affecting our thinking"
- "Before important choices, I''ll ask myself if this bias is present"

### Creating Effective Plans

**🎯 Be Specific**
Vague: "I''ll use this mental model"
Better: "When deciding whether to take on new projects, I''ll use the Opportunity Cost framework to compare options"

**⏰ Set Clear Triggers**  
- "When I feel stressed about deadlines..."
- "During my weekly planning session..."
- "Before responding to criticism..."

**📍 Choose Real Contexts**
Link your plan to actual situations you encounter regularly.

### The Science Behind Planning

**Implementation Intentions** are proven to dramatically increase follow-through. By pre-deciding when and how you''ll act, you remove decision fatigue from the equation.

**🧠 How It Works:**
1. Identifies specific triggers in your environment
2. Links those triggers to specific actions  
3. Makes behavior more automatic and reliable

### Reminder System

**🔔 Daily Notifications** *(Optional)*
Enable gentle reminders to practice your plan. These work best when:
- Set for consistent times (e.g., morning coffee, lunch break)
- Aligned with your natural routine
- Not overwhelming (one reminder per active plan)

### Plan Quality Tips

**✅ Good Plans Are:**
- Specific about when and where
- Connected to real situations you face
- Actionable (you can actually do them)
- Linked to your original goal

**❌ Avoid Plans That Are:**
- Too vague or general
- Based on perfect conditions
- Overly ambitious for starting out

### Your Next Step

Once you''ve created your plan, it''s time to live it! Go practice applying this mental tool, then return to complete your reflection.

**⏭️ Ready to Reflect?**
If you''ve been practicing your plan for at least a day or two, move to the Reflect screen to capture your insights and unlock the next step.

Remember: The gap between knowing and doing is bridged by planning. Your specific intention is the key to real change.',

-- Reflect Screen Help
('reflect-screen-help', 
'## Capture Your Learning Journey

The **Reflect** screen is where growth becomes permanent. By thoughtfully examining your experiences, you transform temporary insights into lasting wisdom.

### Why Reflection Matters

**🧠 Neuroplasticity**
Reflection literally rewires your brain. When you consciously review experiences, you strengthen the neural pathways that support better thinking.

**📈 Compound Learning**
Each reflection builds on previous ones, creating exponential growth over time.

**🎯 Goal Alignment**
Regular reflection keeps you connected to your original goal and shows how each step contributes to your progress.

### What to Reflect On

**📝 Your Application Experience**
- When did you try to use the mental model or spot the bias?
- What was the situation and context?
- How did it feel to apply this new thinking tool?

**💡 Key Insights**
- What surprised you about using this concept?
- How was it different from your usual thinking patterns?
- What connections did you make to other areas of your life?

**🎯 Practical Impact**
- Did this tool help with your stated goal?
- What would you do differently next time?
- How might you use this concept going forward?

### Writing Effective Reflections

**🌟 Quality Over Quantity**
A few thoughtful sentences are better than long, unfocused rambling.

**💯 Honesty First**
This is for your growth, not for grades. Honest assessment leads to real improvement.

**🔍 Specific Examples**
"I used the mental model when deciding about a work project" is better than "I found it useful."

### Reflection Prompts

**For Mental Models:**
- "When I applied [Model Name] to [specific situation], I discovered..."
- "This thinking framework changed my approach to..."
- "The most valuable aspect of this mental tool was..."

**For Cognitive Biases:**
- "I caught myself falling into [Bias Name] when..."
- "Awareness of this bias helped me..."
- "I noticed this thinking pattern affecting..."

### Your Learning Data

**🔒 Privacy First**
Your reflections are private and secure. We use them only to improve your personalized learning experience.

**📊 Progress Tracking**
Each reflection unlocks the next step in your roadmap and contributes to your overall learning analytics.

**📖 Application Log**
All your reflections are saved in your Application Log, creating a searchable record of your growth journey.

**✅ Submission Requirements**
- At least a few thoughtful sentences about your experience
- Specific examples of application or attempts to apply
- Honest assessment of effectiveness

**🏆 Step Completion**
Once you submit your reflection, the next step in your roadmap unlocks automatically.

### Success Strategies

**⏰ Reflect Soon After Application**
The sooner you reflect after applying a concept, the more accurate and valuable your insights will be.

**🔄 Regular Reviews**
Occasionally revisit old reflections to see patterns and progress in your thinking development.

**🎯 Connect to Goals**
Always tie your reflections back to your original learning goal.

Remember: Reflection is where knowledge becomes wisdom. Take your time and be honest with yourself.',
