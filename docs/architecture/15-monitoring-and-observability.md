# **15. Monitoring and Observability**

This section outlines our strategy for observing the health and performance of LattixIQ once it is live. Our approach is to use tools that are tightly integrated with our Vercel and Supabase stack for a seamless experience.

## **Monitoring Stack**

- **Frontend Performance:** **Vercel Analytics**. This is built into our hosting platform and provides privacy-friendly, real-world performance metrics, including Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) and page load speeds across different devices and regions.
- **Backend Performance:** **Vercel Functions Logs & Supabase Dashboard**. All logs (`console.log`, `console.error`) from our API Routes will be automatically captured and searchable in the Vercel dashboard. The Supabase dashboard provides detailed analytics on database health, query performance, and API usage.
- **Error Tracking:** **Sentry**. We will integrate the Sentry SDK into our Next.js application. It will automatically capture, aggregate, and alert us on unhandled errors that occur on both the frontend and in our backend API routes. This allows for proactive bug detection and resolution.

## **Key Metrics to Monitor**

- **Frontend Metrics:**
    - **Core Web Vitals:** We will track LCP, INP, and CLS via Vercel Analytics to ensure a fast user experience.
    - **JavaScript Error Rate:** We will monitor the percentage of user sessions that are error-free via Sentry.
    - **API Call Health:** We will track the latency and error rates of API calls as observed from the client-side.
- **Backend Metrics:**
    - **API Route Performance:** We will monitor the invocation count, duration, and error rate (5xx status codes) of our serverless functions in the Vercel dashboard.
    - **Database Performance:** We will use the Supabase dashboard to monitor query performance, index hit rates, and overall database health.
    - **Authentication Rates:** We will monitor successful vs. failed login attempts via the Supabase Auth dashboard.
