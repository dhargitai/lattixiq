# 2. **Product Goal & Vision**

- **Goal (V1):** To provide users with a tangible "win" by helping them solve one specific, self-identified problem through a guided, AI-curated learning path of 5-7 mental models or cognitive biases.
- **Vision (Long-Term):** To become an indispensable lifelong thinking partner that helps users build a comprehensive "latticework of mental models". We aim to fundamentally upgrade our users' thinking processes, enabling them to navigate life's complexities with greater wisdom, rationality, and resilience.
