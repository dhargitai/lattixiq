# Story 4.3: Implement Testimonial Reward System (Senja.io Integration)

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** user

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 4.2 completion:

- User tracking fields already exist: testimonial_bonus_used, testimonial_url
- Subscription checking utilities at `/lib/subscription/check-limits.ts` ready for integration
- QuickActions component handles premium gating on toolkit page
- Database functions handle atomic roadmap creation with tracking

### Key Implementation Change: Senja.io Integration

**Instead of custom database implementation:**

- Using Senja.io third-party service for testimonial collection
- No testimonials table needed in database
- No API endpoints for testimonial submission
- Manual process for granting bonus roadmaps

### Senja.io Embed Code

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://widget.senja.io/js/iframeResizer.min.js"></script>
<iframe
  id="senja-collector-iframe"
  src="https://senja.io/p/lattixiq/r/eOsaq7?mode=embed&nostyle=true"
  allow="camera;microphone"
  title="Senja form"
  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="no"
  width="100%"
  height="700"
>
</iframe>
<script type="text/javascript">
  iFrameResize({ log: false, checkOrigin: false }, "#senja-collector-iframe");
</script>
```

### Manual Admin Process

1. User submits testimonial through Senja.io form (using same email as login)
2. Admin periodically checks Senja.io dashboard for new testimonials
3. Admin manually updates user.testimonial_url field in database
4. User gains access to bonus roadmap (process takes ~1 day as communicated)

### Component Specifications

**TestimonialCard Component** [Source: prototypes/my-toolkit.html#69-149]:

- Background gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #EBF4FF 0%, #E6F7FF 100%)`
- Border: `1px solid #BEE3F8`
- Border radius: 16px
- Padding: 24px
- Margin bottom: 32px
- Close button in top-right (32x32px circle)
- Animation: slideIn 0.4s ease-out
- Min height to accommodate Senja iframe (700px)

### Frontend Alignment

Based on frontend-spec [Source: docs/frontend-spec.md#146-161]:

- Card appears at top of My Toolkit screen (not modal)
- Trigger 1: After first roadmap completion
- Trigger 2: After 3+ roadmaps with high ratings if first was dismissed
- Clear dismissal tracking to prevent re-showing
- Congratulatory messaging for trigger 1
- Adapted messaging for trigger 2

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]:

- Component: `/components/features/testimonial/TestimonialCard.tsx`
- Page updates: `/app/(app)/toolkit/page.tsx`
- Utility updates: `/lib/subscription/check-limits.ts`

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md]:

- Component tests: `/tests/unit/components/testimonial-card.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `/tests/integration/testimonial-flow.test.ts`
- Use Vitest for unit/integration tests
- Test naming: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`

Test scenarios to cover:

- Happy: First roadmap completion triggers card
- Happy: Card displays Senja form correctly
- Happy: Dismissal prevents re-showing
- Happy: Second trigger after sustained success
- Unhappy: Card doesn't show for incomplete roadmaps
- Unhappy: Card doesn't show after second dismissal

### Technical Constraints

- Follow functional programming style [Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md#8-23]
- Use shadcn/ui components (v2.0.0) [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#9]
- Tailwind CSS v4.0.0 for styling [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#10]
- No direct database writes from client [Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md#182-212]

### Security Considerations

- No sensitive data stored client-side
- Manual admin process prevents automated exploitation
- Existing testimonial_bonus_used flag prevents multiple bonuses

### Implementation Notes

1. **Senja Integration**: Embed provided iframe code directly in TestimonialCard
2. **User Instructions**: Clear messaging about using same email for identification
3. **Manual Process Communication**: Set expectation of ~1 day processing time
4. **Dismissal Logic**: Store in user preferences
5. **Trigger Logic**: Check roadmap completion count and ratings for second trigger
6. **Card Positioning**: Display at top of My Toolkit screen above other content

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md]:

- Test file locations:
  - `/tests/unit/components/testimonial-card.test.tsx` - Component tests
  - `/tests/integration/testimonial-flow.test.ts` - Flow tests
- Use Vitest for test runner
- Mock Senja iframe in tests
- Test naming convention: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`

### Key Test Scenarios

1. Testimonial card appears after first roadmap completion
2. Card displays at top of My Toolkit screen
3. Senja form embeds correctly
4. Card shows one-time offer messaging
5. Dismissal prevents card from re-appearing
6. Second trigger works after sustained success
7. Manual bonus process instructions are clear
8. Card doesn't appear for users with active subscription
