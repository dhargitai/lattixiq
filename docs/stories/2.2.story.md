# Story 2.2: Plan Screen - Create Implementation Intention/Spotting Mission

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user who has learned about a mental model or cognitive bias
**I want** to create a specific plan for applying this concept in my life
**So that** I can bridge the gap between knowing and doing

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Plan screen displays after user clicks "Continue to Plan" from Learn screen
2. Shows different form fields based on content type:
   - Mental Models: Implementation Intention form (Situation, Trigger, Action)
   - Cognitive Biases/Fallacies: Spotting Mission form (adapted fields)
3. Each field has clear labels and helpful placeholder text
4. Displays relevant goal example from goal_examples table above the form (if available)
   - Shows if_then_example for mental models
   - Shows spotting_mission_example for cognitive biases/fallacies
   - Example is in an expandable card that can be collapsed
5. Form validates that all required fields are filled before submission
6. "Save Plan" button saves the plan and navigates to roadmap view
7. Plan data is stored in the roadmap_step record (plan_situation, plan_trigger, plan_action, plan_created_at)
8. Loading state while saving plan
9. Error handling if save fails
10. Back navigation returns to Learn screen
11. Mobile-responsive form layout

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.1 (Learn Screen):

- Learn screen successfully implemented with `/app/(app)/learn/[stepId]/` route structure
- Navigation flow established: Roadmap ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Plan
- Using Zustand store for state management with currentStep and knowledgeContent
- Database fields use snake_case naming (e.g., `knowledge_content`, `plan_situation`)
- "Continue to Plan" button navigates to `/plan/[stepId]`

### Route Structure

The plan screen uses dynamic routing:

```text
/app/(app)/plan/[stepId]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx           # Main plan page
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/         # Integration tests
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.test.tsx
```

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Routing Structure]

### Component Architecture

Follow established patterns:

- Use `React.forwardRef` for all components
- TypeScript interfaces extending HTML attributes
- Use `cn()` utility for Tailwind classes
- Place in `/components/features/roadmap/`

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]

### Data Models

Import types from auto-generated file:

```typescript
import type {
  RoadmapStep,
  RoadmapStepUpdate,
  KnowledgeContent,
  GoalExample,
} from "@/lib/supabase/types";
```

**Goal Examples Table:**

```typescript
// Database structure for goal_examples:
type GoalExample = {
  id: string;
  knowledge_content_id: string;
  goal: string; // The user goal this example addresses
  if_then_example: string | null; // Example for mental models
  spotting_mission_example: string | null; // Example for cognitive biases/fallacies
};
```

**Plan-related fields in RoadmapStep:**

```typescript
// These are the actual database column names (snake_case):
type RoadmapStep = {
  id: string;
  roadmap_id: string;
  knowledge_content_id: string;
  status: "locked" | "unlocked" | "completed" | null;
  order: number;
  plan_situation: string | null; // User's situation/context
  plan_trigger: string | null; // Specific cue/trigger
  plan_action: string | null; // Intended action/response
  plan_created_at: string | null; // ISO timestamp when plan was created
};
```

**Form Data Interface:**

```typescript
interface PlanFormData {
  situation: string;
  trigger: string;
  action: string;
}

// Extended type for UI components with goal examples:
interface RoadmapStepWithContentAndExamples extends RoadmapStep {
  knowledge_content: KnowledgeContent;
  goal_examples: GoalExample[];
}
```

[Source: architecture/3-data-models.md#Type System Overview]

### Form Patterns

Based on architecture guidelines:

- Use controlled components or React Hook Form
- Validate on submit and show inline errors
- Disable submit button during API calls
- Show loading states appropriately

**Update Pattern:**

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("roadmap_steps")
  .update({
    plan_situation: formData.situation,
    plan_trigger: formData.trigger,
    plan_action: formData.action,
    plan_created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  })
  .eq("id", stepId);
```

### UI Components

Use shadcn/ui components:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Textarea } from "@/components/ui/textarea";
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";
import { ChevronDown } from "lucide-react";
```

**Goal Example Display Pattern:**

```tsx
{
  goalExample && (
    <Card className="mb-6">
      <CardHeader className="cursor-pointer" onClick={() => setShowExample(!showExample)}>
        <CardTitle className="text-base flex items-center justify-between">
          <span>üìù Example: {goalExample.goal}</span>
          <ChevronDown
            className={cn("h-4 w-4 transition-transform", showExample && "rotate-180")}
          />
        </CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      {showExample && (
        <CardContent>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground italic">
            {contentType === "mental-model"
              ? goalExample.if_then_example
              : goalExample.spotting_mission_example}
          </p>
        </CardContent>
      )}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Content Type Variations

**For Mental Models (Implementation Intention):**

- Situation: "Describe a specific situation where you'll apply this model"
- Trigger: "What will remind you to use it?"
- Action: "What exactly will you do?"

**For Cognitive Biases/Fallacies (Spotting Mission):**

- Situation: "Where might you encounter this bias?"
- Trigger: "What signs will you look for?"
- Action: "How will you respond when you spot it?"

### State Management

Continue using Zustand store:

- Access currentStep and knowledgeContent
- Clear plan data on navigation away
- Consider persisting draft state

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#State Management]

### File Locations

**To be created:**

- `/app/(app)/plan/[stepId]/page.tsx` - Dynamic plan page
- `/components/features/roadmap/PlanScreen.tsx` - Main component
- `/app/(app)/plan/__tests__/plan.test.tsx` - Integration tests

**To be modified:**

- `/lib/stores/roadmap-store.ts` - Add plan form state if needed

### Technical Constraints

- Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router
- React 19.1.0
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS v4.0.0
- shadcn/ui v2.0.0 components

[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#Frontend Stack]

### Testing

Following Testing Strategy:

- **Integration Tests**: Primary focus for form interactions
- **Unit Tests**: Only if complex validation logic needed
- Test location: Colocated in `__tests__` directories
- Mock Supabase API calls
- Test form submission flow end-to-end
