# Story 2.3: Reflect Screen - Journal Application Experience

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** user who has created and executed an implementation plan for a mental model or cognitive bias
**I want** to reflect on my experience by logging what happened and rating the model's effectiveness
**So that** I can unlock the next step in my roadmap and build self-awareness of which concepts work best for me

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Reflect screen displays after user has created a plan and returns to that roadmap step
2. Shows user's saved plan text as a reminder of what they intended to do
3. Provides structured form for reflection with two main sections:
   - "Describe what happened" - a text area for detailed reflection (minimum 50 characters)
   - "How effective was this model for you?" - a 5-star rating system
4. Form validates that minimum text length is met and a rating is selected before submission
5. "Complete & Unlock Next Step" button saves the reflection and updates roadmap step status to completed
6. Reflection data is stored in application_logs table with all required fields
7. Loading state while saving reflection
8. Error handling if save fails
9. Back navigation allows user to return to Learn screen for concept recap
10. Success feedback when reflection is completed successfully
11. Mobile-responsive layout with engaging visual design

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.2 (Plan Screen):

- Plan screen successfully implemented with `/app/(app)/plan/[stepId]/` route structure
- Navigation flow established: Roadmap → Learn → Plan → Reflect
- Using Zustand store for state management with currentStep and knowledgeContent
- Database fields use snake_case naming (e.g., `plan_situation`, `plan_trigger`, `plan_action`)
- Plan data is stored in roadmap_step record and should be displayed as reminder
- "Complete & Unlock Next Step" button pattern established

### Route Structure

The reflect screen uses dynamic routing:

```text
/app/(app)/reflect/[stepId]/
├── page.tsx           # Main reflect page
└── __tests__/         # Integration tests
    └── reflect.test.tsx
```

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Routing Structure]

### Component Architecture

Follow established patterns:

- Use `React.forwardRef` for all components
- TypeScript interfaces extending HTML attributes
- Use `cn()` utility for Tailwind classes
- Place in `/components/features/roadmap/`

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]

### Data Models

Import types from auto-generated file:

```typescript
import type {
  RoadmapStep,
  RoadmapStepUpdate,
  KnowledgeContent,
  ApplicationLog,
  ApplicationLogInsert,
  ApplicationLogUpdate,
} from "@/lib/supabase/types";
```

**Application Log Table (Primary data model for this story):**

```typescript
// Database structure for application_logs:
type ApplicationLog = {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  roadmap_step_id: string;
  situation_text: string | null; // User's description of what happened
  learning_text: string | null; // User's reflection on what they learned
  effectiveness_rating: number | null; // Self-rated score from 1-5
  ai_sentiment: "positive" | "negative" | "neutral" | null; // AI-populated later
  ai_topics: string[] | null; // AI-populated later
  created_at: string | null; // ISO timestamp
};
```

**Form Data Interface:**

```typescript
interface ReflectFormData {
  reflectionText: string; // Combined situation and learning for V1
  rating: number; // 1-5 star rating
}

// Extended type for UI components with plan data:
interface RoadmapStepWithPlan extends RoadmapStep {
  knowledge_content: KnowledgeContent;
  roadmap: Roadmap;
}
```

[Source: architecture/3-data-models.md#ApplicationLog]

### Form Patterns

Based on architecture guidelines:

- Use controlled components or React Hook Form
- Validate on input change and show real-time feedback
- Disable submit button until all validation passes
- Show loading states appropriately

**Database Insert Pattern:**

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.from("application_logs").insert({
  user_id: user?.id,
  roadmap_step_id: stepId,
  situation_text: formData.reflectionText,
  learning_text: formData.reflectionText, // Combined for V1
  effectiveness_rating: formData.rating,
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
});

// Also update roadmap step status
if (!error) {
  await supabase.from("roadmap_steps").update({ status: "completed" }).eq("id", stepId);
}
```

### UI Components

Use shadcn/ui components:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Textarea } from "@/components/ui/textarea";
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";
import { Star } from "lucide-react";
```

**Plan Reminder Display Pattern:**

```tsx
{
  step?.plan_situation && step?.plan_trigger && step?.plan_action && (
    <Card className="mb-6 border-l-4 border-l-green-500 bg-green-50">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle className="text-base text-green-800">Your Plan:</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <p className="text-sm text-green-700 italic">
          IF: {step.plan_situation} → THEN: {step.plan_action}
        </p>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

**Star Rating Component Pattern:**

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-center space-x-2">
  {[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((star) => (
    <Button
      key={star}
      variant="ghost"
      size="sm"
      className={cn(
        "p-1 hover:bg-transparent",
        rating >= star ? "text-yellow-500" : "text-gray-300"
      )}
      onClick={() => setRating(star)}
    >
      <Star className="h-8 w-8 fill-current" />
    </Button>
  ))}
</div>
```

### Frontend Alignment Notes

Based on `prototypes/reflect.html`:

- **Plan Reminder Section**: Green-tinted card with target emoji and italic text
- **Form Structure**: Two main sections - reflection text area and star rating
- **Character Counter**: Real-time feedback showing current count vs minimum (50 chars)
- **Star Rating**: Interactive 5-star system with hover effects and feedback text
- **Submit Button**: Disabled until validation passes, shows loading state
- **Success Overlay**: Modal with celebration message and continue button
- **Visual Design**: Clean, minimalist with green accent colors and smooth animations

Key prototype features to implement:

- Progress indicator showing "Step X of Y • Reflect"
- Auto-expanding textarea with minimum height
- Hover/active states for interactive elements
- Success animation with confetti or celebration icon
- Mobile-responsive design with appropriate touch targets

[Source: prototypes/reflect.html - complete form structure and interactions]

### State Management

Continue using Zustand store:

- Access currentStep and knowledgeContent
- Store reflection form state during composition
- Clear reflection data on successful submission
- Handle navigation state between Learn/Plan/Reflect

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#State Management]

### File Locations

**To be created:**

- `/app/(app)/reflect/[stepId]/page.tsx` - Dynamic reflect page
- `/components/features/roadmap/ReflectScreen.tsx` - Main component
- `/app/(app)/reflect/__tests__/reflect.test.tsx` - Integration tests

**To be modified:**

- `/lib/stores/roadmap-store.ts` - Add reflection form state if needed

### Technical Constraints

- Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router
- React 19.1.0
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS v4.0.0
- shadcn/ui v2.0.0 components

[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#Frontend Stack]

### Testing

Following Testing Strategy:

- **Integration Tests**: Primary focus for form interactions and data persistence
- **Unit Tests**: For validation logic and rating component if complex
- Test location: Colocated in `__tests__` directories
- Mock Supabase API calls
- Test complete reflection submission flow
- Test form validation with multiple scenarios
- Test navigation between Learn and Reflect screens
