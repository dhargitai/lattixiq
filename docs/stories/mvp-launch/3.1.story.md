## Technical Specifications

### Implementation Details

**Current HelpModal Structure:**

- Located at `/components/modals/HelpModal.tsx`
- Uses shadcn/ui Dialog, ScrollArea, and markdown rendering
- Renders dynamic content from Supabase content_blocks table
- Has consistent styling with prose classes

**Target Implementation:**

- Add support email section after the rendered markdown content
- Use border-top to visually separate from main content
- Maintain existing component styling and accessibility

### Files to Update

- `/components/modals/HelpModal.tsx` - Add support email link section

### Code Implementation

```jsx
// Add after line 126 in HelpModal.tsx, within the renderContent() return:
<div className="mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-gray-200">
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
    If you have any more questions, feel free to{" "}
    <a
      href="mailto:support@lattixiq.com"
      className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-2 rounded-sm"
      aria-label="Contact support via email at support@lattixiq.com"
    >
      shoot an email
    </a>
    .
  </p>
</div>
```

### Accessibility Requirements

- Email link must have proper aria-label for screen readers
- Focus indicator must be visible when navigating with keyboard

- Touch target must meet 44x44px minimum for mobile

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- HelpModal component structure
- Existing modal styling system
- Email client integration on user's device

### Data Dependencies

- None - static implementation

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing

- [ ] Test HelpModal renders with support email link
- [ ] Test email link has correct href attribute
- [ ] Test email link has proper accessibility attributes
- [ ] Test visual styling matches design specifications

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Test HelpModal works across all screens using different contentId values
- [ ] Test email link functionality on different browsers
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation to email link

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Verify email link appears in help modal on all screens
- [ ] Test clicking email link opens default email client
- [ ] Test email link styling matches existing modal design
- [ ] Test accessibility with screen reader
- [ ] Test on mobile devices for proper touch target size

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Support email link added to HelpModal component
- [ ] Email link opens mailto:support@lattixiq.com
- [ ] Link uses consistent styling with modal design
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (screen reader, focus, contrast)
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] Mobile touch target testing completed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] No visual regression in help modal layout

## Development Tasks

### Task 1: Implement Support Email Link (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

- [ ] Modify HelpModal.tsx renderContent() method
- [ ] Add support email section with proper styling
- [ ] Implement mailto link with correct email address
- [ ] Add consistent messaging as specified in requirements
- [ ] Ensure link styling matches modal design

### Task 2: Implement Accessibility Features (AC: 6)

- [ ] Add proper aria-label to email link
- [ ] Implement focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Verify color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Test with screen reader for proper announcement

### Task 3: Testing and Validation

- [ ] Write unit tests for HelpModal support email functionality
- [ ] Test email link functionality across browsers
- [ ] Verify mobile touch target meets 44x44px minimum
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation and focus management
- [ ] Validate HTML structure and semantic markup

## Dev Notes

### Component Architecture Context

**HelpModal Component Structure** [Source: components/modals/HelpModal.tsx]

- Uses shadcn/ui Dialog components (Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogDescription)
- Renders markdown content using ReactMarkdown with custom styling
- Uses ScrollArea for content overflow management
- Has error and loading states with proper UI feedback
- Content is fetched dynamically from Supabase content_blocks table

**Styling System** [Source: docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md]

- Uses Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS variables for theming
- Components follow shadcn/ui design patterns (New York style)
- Prose classes used for markdown content rendering
- Color system uses blue-600/blue-800 for links consistently

**File Location** [Source: docs/architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]

- HelpModal located in `/components/` > `/modals/` following feature organization
- Modal components are in their own subdirectory for organization
- Uses absolute imports with `@/` path alias

### Frontend Alignment Notes

**Modal Design Patterns** [Source: docs/frontend-spec.md]

- Follows "Serene Minimalist" aesthetic with generous white space
- Content cards use soft rounded corners and subtle borders
- Typography uses consistent sizing (text-sm for body text)
- Interactive elements have hover states for feedback

**Email Link Design Requirements**

- Must use text-blue-600 base color with hover:text-blue-800
- Underline styling for clear link identification
- Focus indicators for accessibility
- Touch target minimum 44x44px on mobile

### Testing Standards [Source: docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md]

**Unit Testing Requirements**

- Use Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Test files should be in `/tests/unit/components/modals/`
- Follow pattern: `HelpModal.test.tsx`
- Test both happy path (link renders) and edge cases

**Integration Testing Requirements**

- Test HelpModal functionality across different contentId values
- Verify email client integration works across browsers
- Test accessibility with automated tools and manual verification

**Test Structure**

```typescript
// Test file location: /tests/unit/components/modals/HelpModal.test.tsx
describe("HelpModal Support Email", () => {
  // Happy path
  it("should render support email link with correct attributes", () => {});

  // Accessibility
  it("should have proper aria-label for screen readers", () => {});

  // Styling
  it("should match existing modal design patterns", () => {});
});
```

### Technical Constraints

**Browser Compatibility**

- Email links work on all modern browsers
- mailto: protocol support is universal
- No additional dependencies required

**Performance Considerations**

- Static implementation adds minimal overhead
- No additional API calls or data fetching
- Component render performance unchanged

**Security Considerations** [Source: docs/architecture/12-coding-standards.md]

- Email address is not sensitive information
- No user data exposure in email links
- Standard mailto: protocol is secure
