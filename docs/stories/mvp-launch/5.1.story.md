  - [x] Test with various email providers (Gmail, Outlook)
  - [x] Verify email delivery in Resend dashboard

- [x] Implement logging and monitoring (AC: 6)

  - [x] Track delivery status, timestamps, and errors
  - [x] Create monitoring utilities for tracking delivery rates
  - [x] Ensure logs don't contain sensitive user data

- [x] Add unit tests (per Testing Strategy)
  - [x] Create `/tests/unit/email/resend-client.test.ts`
  - [x] Test email service initialization
  - [x] Test error handling scenarios
  - [x] Mock Resend API calls using Vitest

- [x] Add integration tests (per Testing Strategy)

  - [x] Test complete email sending flow with mocked Resend
  - [x] Test retry logic and error scenarios
  - [x] Verify logging functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous story directly related to email integration.

### Data Models

**notification_logs table** - Used for tracking email delivery

- `id`: UUID primary key
- `user_id`: Foreign key to users table
- `type`: Notification type (will include 'email')
- `status`: Delivery status
- `sent_at`: Timestamp of send attempt
- `error`: Error message if failed
  [Source: architecture/7-database-schema.md]

### API Specifications

No existing email API endpoints. Will create new utilities in `/lib/email/` directory.
[Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md#lib]

### Component Specifications

Not applicable - backend service only.

### Frontend Alignment

Not applicable - backend service only.

### File Locations

Based on project structure:

- `/lib/email/` - New directory for email utilities
- `/lib/email/resend-client.ts` - Resend client initialization
- `/lib/email/send-email.ts` - Main email sending function
- `/tests/unit/email/` - Unit tests
- `/tests/integration/email/` - Integration tests
  [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements

- Follow TDD approach: Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Mock all external services (Resend) using Vitest
- Test both happy and unhappy paths
- Use separate test database via .env.test
  [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints

- **Security**: Never hardcode API keys - use environment variables
- **Security**: Service role keys only in server-side context
- **Security**: Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive info
- **Coding Standards**: Follow functional programming patterns
- **Coding Standards**: Use camelCase for functions/variables
- **Tech Stack**: Notification service is "To be determined" but should be abstracted
  [Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md#security-standards]
  [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#notifications]

### Integration with Existing Cron Job

The existing reminder cron job is located at `/app/api/notifications/cron/route.ts`. This cron job:

- Runs periodically to check for users with reminders enabled
- Filters users based on timezone and reminder time
- Currently only handles browser notifications
- Email sending will be integrated alongside existing notification logic
  [Source: app/api/notifications/cron/route.ts]

## Testing

- Unit tests in `/tests/unit/email/` for Resend client and utilities
- Integration tests in `/tests/integration/email/` for complete flow
- Mock Resend API calls to avoid external dependencies
- Test error scenarios including API failures and invalid emails
- Verify environment variable validation
