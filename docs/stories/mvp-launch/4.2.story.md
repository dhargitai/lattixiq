# Story 4.2: Optimized Homepage Flow

**Story ID:** 4.2  
**Epic:** EPIC-004 - Authentication & Access Flow Optimization  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Done
**Story Points:** 1  
**Sprint:** MVP Launch  
**Assignee:** Frontend Team

## User Story

**As a** returning user  
**I want** to be directed straight to the main application  
**So that** I don't need to navigate through unnecessary landing pages

## Business Value

- **User Flow Optimization:** Direct homepage redirect improves returning user experience
- **Reduced Friction:** Eliminates extra navigation steps for authenticated users
- **Improved Retention:** Faster access to core functionality increases user engagement
- **Consistent UX:** Aligns with "My Toolkit" as the permanent home and central hub

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Redirect homepage (/) to /toolkit path
2. Ensure /toolkit handles authentication redirects properly
3. Maintain existing /toolkit → /new-roadmap redirect logic for first-time users
4. Preserve SEO considerations if applicable
5. Test redirect behavior for both authenticated and unauthenticated users
6. Ensure no redirect loops occur

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Implement Homepage Redirect (AC: 1)

- [x] Modify app/page.tsx to implement redirect to /toolkit
- [x] Use Next.js redirect() function from "next/navigation"
- [x] Replace existing homepage content with redirect logic
- [x] Test redirect occurs immediately on page load

### Task 2: Verify Toolkit Authentication Handling (AC: 2)

- [x] Review existing /toolkit authentication logic
- [x] Ensure proper handling of unauthenticated users
- [x] Verify redirect chain: / → /toolkit → /login (if not authenticated)
- [x] Test authentication state persistence

### Task 3: Preserve First-Time User Flow (AC: 3)

- [x] Verify existing /toolkit → /new-roadmap redirect for users without roadmaps
- [x] Ensure new user flow remains: / → /toolkit → /login → /new-roadmap
- [x] Test complete onboarding journey after authentication
- [x] Maintain proper state management throughout flow

### Task 4: SEO and Performance Optimization (AC: 4)

- [x] Implement server-side redirect (301) if SEO is important
- [x] Consider sitemap.xml updates if necessary
- [x] Verify redirect doesn't impact search engine indexing
- [x] Test redirect performance and loading times

### Task 5: Testing and Validation (AC: 5, 6)

- [x] Test authenticated user redirect behavior
- [x] Test unauthenticated user redirect chain
- [x] Verify no infinite redirect loops occur
- [x] Test browser back/forward navigation
- [x] Test across different browsers and devices
- [x] Write unit tests for homepage redirect logic

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Previous Story 4.1 simplified the login interface by removing social login options. This story builds on that by optimizing the user journey to reduce friction after authentication.

### Component Architecture Context

**Homepage Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]

- Located at `/app/page.tsx` (root page of the application)
- Uses Next.js 15.0.0 App Router with server components
- Current homepage likely serves as landing page

**Toolkit Page Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]

- Located at `/app/(app)/toolkit/page.tsx`
- Part of protected route group requiring authentication
- Serves as main dashboard and central hub for users

**Authentication Middleware** [Source: docs/architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]

- Located at `/middleware.ts`
- Handles route protection and authentication guards
- Manages redirect logic for protected routes

### Frontend Alignment Notes

**User Journey Logic** [Source: docs/frontend-spec.md#user-journey-logic]

- My Toolkit serves as permanent home screen for returning users
- After roadmap generation, users go directly to Roadmap View
- My Toolkit displays active roadmap with clear resume link
- Supports both authenticated and unauthenticated user flows

**Information Architecture** [Source: docs/frontend-spec.md#information-architecture]

- My Toolkit is central hub after goal selection
- Provides access to active roadmaps, learned models, and application log
- Designed as primary landing point for authenticated users

### Technical Implementation Details

**Next.js Redirect Implementation** [Source: EPIC-004-authentication-access-flow.md]

```jsx
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export default function Home() {
  redirect("/toolkit");
}
```

**Authentication Flow Context** [Source: EPIC-004-authentication-access-flow.md]

1. User visits homepage (/)
2. **NEW:** Automatic redirect to /toolkit
3. /toolkit checks authentication status via middleware
4. If not authenticated → redirect to /login
5. If authenticated but no roadmaps → redirect to /new-roadmap
6. If authenticated with roadmaps → show toolkit interface

### Testing Standards [Source: docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md]

**Unit Testing Requirements**

- Test files should be located in `/tests/unit/app/`
- Follow pattern: `homepage-redirect.test.tsx`
- Use Vitest v1.6.0 with React Testing Library for component testing
- Test redirect logic and behavior

**Integration Testing Requirements**

- Test complete authentication flow with homepage redirect
- Verify redirect chain works correctly for different user states
- Use mocked authentication service in sandboxed environment
- Test browser navigation behavior (back button, direct URLs)

**E2E Testing Requirements**

- Use Playwright v1.45.0 to test complete user journeys
- Test scenarios: new user, returning user, logged out user
- Verify no redirect loops in real browser environment
- Test across different browsers and viewport sizes

**Test Structure Requirements**

```typescript
// Test file location: /tests/unit/app/homepage.test.tsx
describe("Homepage Redirect", () => {
  // Happy path
  it("should redirect to /toolkit immediately", () => {});

  // Authentication flow
  it("should handle unauthenticated users correctly", () => {});

  // Edge cases
  it("should not create redirect loops", () => {});
});
```

### Technical Constraints

**SEO Considerations** [Source: EPIC-004-authentication-access-flow.md]

- Consider implementing 301 redirect for SEO preservation
- May need sitemap.xml updates if search indexing is important
- Monitor search engine behavior after redirect implementation

**Browser Compatibility**

- Next.js redirect() function works across all modern browsers
- Server-side redirects are universally supported
- No additional dependencies required

**Performance Considerations**

- Server-side redirect minimizes client-side JavaScript execution
- Redirect happens before page content loads
- No impact on Core Web Vitals metrics

**Security Considerations** [Source: docs/architecture/12-coding-standards.md]

- Redirect preserves existing authentication security
- No exposure of sensitive routes or data
- Maintains proper middleware protection for /toolkit route
- No additional security vulnerabilities introduced

### Middleware Integration

**Authentication Middleware Behavior** [Source: middleware.ts expected location]

- Middleware should handle /toolkit route protection
- Redirect to /login if user not authenticated
- Preserve intended destination for post-login redirect
- Handle session validation and token refresh
