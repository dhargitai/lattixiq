# Story 7.8: Update Test Suite

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** all tests to work with the new implementation  
**So that** we maintain code quality and coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `new-roadmap.test.tsx` mocks database instead of localStorage
2. `plan-modal-flow.test.tsx` uses database mocks
3. `roadmap-creation.spec.ts` E2E test assertions updated
4. `logout-button.test.tsx` localStorage mocks removed
5. All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
6. Test coverage maintained or improved

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Remove all localStorage.setItem/getItem mocks
  - [ ] Add Supabase database query mocks for roadmap_count

  - [ ] Run `npm run test:unit`
  - [ ] Run `npm run test:integration`
  - [ ] Run `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_TEST=true npm run test:e2e`
  - [ ] Fix any test failures discovered
  - [ ] Verify all tests pass locally
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline passes (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Push changes to feature branch

  - [ ] Fix any CI-specific failures
  - [ ] Ensure test coverage reports are generated
  - [ ] Verify coverage percentage meets or exceeds baseline

## Dev Notes

### Test File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: docs/architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]:

```
/tests/unit/        - Unit tests
/tests/integration/ - Integration tests
/tests/e2e/        - Playwright E2E tests
```

### Testing Framework Stack

[Source: docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:

- **Unit/Integration Tests**: Vitest v1.6.0
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright v1.45.0
- **React Testing**: React Testing Library

### Testing Philosophy

[Source: docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Testing Philosophy]:

- Follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- "Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration."
- Test both happy and unhappy paths
- Use mocked services for external dependencies

### Mocking Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Sandboxed Test Environment]:

- Use Mock Service Worker (MSW) for frontend tests
- Use Vitest's built-in mocking for backend tests
- All external services must be mocked
- Test database connection via `.env.test`

### Required Test Coverage

[Source: docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Happy and Unhappy Path Coverage]:
Both successful and failure scenarios must be tested:

- Happy path: Normal user flow
- Unhappy paths: Error states, edge cases, validation failures

### Database Mocking Pattern

When replacing localStorage with database calls:

```typescript
// Mock the user-preferences functions
vi.mock("@/lib/db/user-preferences", () => ({
  hasCompletedOnboarding: vi.fn(), // Checks roadmap_count > 0
  hasShownModal: vi.fn(),
  addShownModal: vi.fn(),
}));
```

### E2E Test Environment

For E2E tests with Playwright:

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_TEST=true` environment variable
- Tests should use actual database (test instance)
- Clean up test data after each test run

### Console Output Management

[Source: CLAUDE.md#Console Output Management]:

- Normal test runs suppress console outputs
- Failed tests display captured console outputs
- Set `VERBOSE_TEST_LOGS=true` for verbose output

### Files Likely Needing Updates

Based on localStorage usage identified in Epic:

1. `/tests/unit/components/new-roadmap.test.tsx`
2. `/tests/integration/plan-modal-flow.test.tsx`
3. `/tests/e2e/roadmap-creation.spec.ts`
4. `/tests/unit/components/logout-button.test.tsx`
5. ~~Theme-provider tests~~ - No theme tests needed
6. Any Zustand store related tests

## Testing

- Verify all unit tests pass: `npm run test:unit`
- Verify all integration tests pass: `npm run test:integration`
- Verify E2E tests pass: `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_TEST=true npm run test:e2e`
- Check test coverage report maintains >80% coverage
- Ensure no localStorage references remain in test files
- Verify CI/CD pipeline passes on GitHub Actions
