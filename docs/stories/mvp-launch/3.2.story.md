# Story 3.2: Streamlined Toolkit Interface

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** new user exploring the toolkit  
**I want** a focused interface that highlights core features  
**So that** I can understand the primary value without distraction

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Comment out "My Completed Roadmaps" panel in NavigationCards
2. Comment out "Application Log" panel in NavigationCards
3. Ensure remaining interface elements are properly aligned
4. Maintain component structure for easy re-enabling post-MVP
5. Update any navigation logic that depends on hidden panels
6. Verify no JavaScript errors from hidden components

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Locate and modify NavigationCards component (AC: 1, 2, 4)
  - [ ] Navigate to `/components/features/toolkit/NavigationCards.tsx`
  - [ ] Identify the Trophy (Completed Roadmaps) card JSX block
  - [ ] Comment out the entire Trophy card using block comments `{/* ... */}`
  - [ ] Identify the FileText (Application Log) card JSX block
  - [ ] Comment out the entire FileText card using block comments `{/* ... */}`
  - [ ] Add a comment above each block: `// Hidden for MVP - will be re-enabled post-launch`
- [ ] Task 2: Verify interface alignment and layout (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Check that remaining cards (My Learned Models) display correctly
  - [ ] Verify grid layout adjusts properly with only one card
  - [ ] Test responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop views
  - [ ] Ensure spacing and padding remain consistent
- [ ] Task 3: Check for and fix any navigation dependencies (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Search for any references to the hidden navigation paths
  - [ ] Update any route definitions that might reference `/toolkit/completed` or `/toolkit/application-log`
  - [ ] Verify no broken links exist in the application
- [ ] Task 4: Test for JavaScript errors (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Open browser developer console
  - [ ] Navigate to the toolkit page
  - [ ] Verify no console errors related to missing components
  - [ ] Check that remaining functionality works correctly
- [ ] Task 5: Write unit tests for the changes
  - [ ] Create or update test file at `/tests/unit/components/NavigationCards.test.tsx`
  - [ ] Test that only the "My Learned Models" card renders
  - [ ] Test that commented sections don't affect component functionality
  - [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors with the changes

## Dev Notes

### Component Location

- **File Path**: `/components/features/toolkit/NavigationCards.tsx` [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md - /components/features section]
- This component is part of the toolkit feature components

### Frontend Architecture Pattern

- Components follow the tiered structure with `/features` containing route-specific components [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture]
- Use React.forwardRef pattern if the component needs ref forwarding [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]

### UI Component Details

- NavigationCards uses shadcn/ui components (likely Card components) [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md - UI Components: shadcn/ui]
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS v4.0.0 utility classes [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md - Styling]
- Follow the `cn()` utility pattern for combining Tailwind classes [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]

### Code Commenting Best Practices

- Use JSX block comments `{/* */}` for commenting out JSX elements
- Add clear documentation comments explaining why code is commented (MVP hiding)
- Maintain indentation and structure for easy re-enabling

### TypeScript Considerations

- No TypeScript interfaces should be modified (keep all props/types intact)
- The component should remain fully typed even with sections commented

### Previous Story Context

- This is part of the content management epic focused on streamlining the MVP interface
- Related to improving user onboarding by reducing interface complexity

## Testing

### Test File Location

- Unit tests: `/tests/unit/components/NavigationCards.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `/tests/integration/toolkit/toolkit.test.tsx` (already exists)

### Testing Standards

- Use Vitest for unit testing [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md - Test Types]
- Follow TDD approach if modifying tests [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md - Testing Philosophy]
- Test both happy path (cards render correctly) and unhappy path (no errors with hidden content)
- Mock any external services or API calls if the component uses them [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md - Sandboxed Test Environment]

### Specific Test Cases

```tsx
describe("NavigationCards", () => {
  // Happy Path
  it("should render only My Learned Models card for MVP", () => {
    // Test that only one card is visible
  });

  // Unhappy Path
  it("should not throw errors when panels are commented out", () => {
    // Test component renders without JavaScript errors
  });

  it("should maintain proper layout with single card", () => {
    // Test responsive grid behavior
  });
});
```
