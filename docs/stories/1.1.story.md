# Story 1.1: Create New Roadmap Flow UI

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** new or returning user  
**I want** to create a new personalized learning roadmap  
**So that** I can start or continue my growth journey with relevant content

## Acceptance Criteria

1. New roadmap creation screen with "How this works" section (expanded for new users, collapsed for returning)
2. Question prompt that adapts based on user status (new vs returning)
3. Category buttons that populate starter text in goal input field
4. Goal input with real-time validation feedback
5. Loading state while roadmap generates
6. Smooth transitions between states

  - [ ] Fix any failing tests
  - [ ] Add any missing test cases discovered during implementation
  - [ ] Ensure code coverage meets standards

## Dev Notes

### Route Structure and Organization

The new roadmap flow should be placed in the `/(app)/` route group as it requires authentication. The structure should be:

```
/app/(app)/new-roadmap/
├── page.tsx           # Main new roadmap page
└── __tests__/         # TDD tests written first
    └── new-roadmap.test.tsx
```

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Routing Structure]

### Authentication Flow

Based on the prototype and requirements:

1. User arrives at the site (unauthenticated)
2. Middleware redirects to `/login`
3. After successful authentication, new users are redirected to `/new-roadmap`
4. Returning users can access `/new-roadmap` to create additional roadmaps
   [Source: architecture/6-core-workflows.md#1. New User Registration & First Roadmap Creation]

### Component Architecture

All components should follow the established patterns:

- Use `React.forwardRef` for all components
- Define TypeScript interfaces extending appropriate HTML attributes
- Use `cn()` utility from `/lib/utils` for combining Tailwind classes
- Components go in `/components/features/new-roadmap/` for feature-specific components
  [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]

### UI Implementation from Prototype

Key UI elements from `prototypes/onboarding.html`:

- **Header**: Simple with "LattixIQ" branding
- **Question Title**: Adapts based on `localStorage.getItem('hasCompletedOnboarding')`
- **Category Buttons**: Instead of selection, buttons populate starter text in the goal input
- **How It Works**: Green gradient background, collapsible with smooth transitions
- **Goal Input**: Textarea with auto-resize, real-time validation feedback
- **Submit Button**: Green gradient with hover effects and loading state
- **Success Overlay**: Rocket emoji with fade/slide animation

**Category Button Behavior**: When clicked, category buttons should clear the current input and populate it with starter text that users can then customize. This provides inspiration while maintaining flexibility.
[Source: prototypes/onboarding.html]

### State Management Approach

Follow the hierarchical state management strategy:

1. Local Component State: Use `useState` for form inputs and UI state
2. Global State: Create Zustand store for loading state and user status
3. LocalStorage: Track user status with 'hasCompletedOnboarding' flag (temporary implementation)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The localStorage implementation for checking onboarding status is temporary. In future development (Story 1.5), this should be replaced with a proper database query to check if the user has any saved roadmaps. Add a TODO comment in the code to track this technical debt.
[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#State Management]

### TDD Approach

Following Test-Driven Development:

1. Write tests FIRST before implementation
2. Tests should cover all acceptance criteria
3. Use Vitest + React Testing Library for integration tests
4. Mock Supabase auth using Mock Service Worker (MSW)
5. Run tests frequently during development to ensure they pass
   [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Testing Philosophy]

### Styling and Responsiveness

- Use Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS variables for theming
- Match styling from prototype (green gradients, animations)
- Ensure all components work on mobile devices
- Test on various screen sizes during development
  [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#Frontend Stack]

### Previous Story Context

From Story 0.7, comprehensive documentation was created including:

- Code style guide with TypeScript conventions
- Testing strategy emphasizing TDD for new features
- Component patterns documented
  These standards should be followed when implementing the new roadmap UI.

### Testing

Following TDD approach, tests must be written FIRST:

- Test file location: `/app/(app)/new-roadmap/__tests__/new-roadmap.test.tsx`
- Use Vitest + React Testing Library for integration tests
- Mock Supabase auth and API calls using MSW
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Ensure tests cover all acceptance criteria before implementation
