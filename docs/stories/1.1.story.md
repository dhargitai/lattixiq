# Story 1.1: Create New Roadmap Flow UI

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** new or returning user  
**I want** to create a new personalized learning roadmap

## Dev Notes

### Route Structure and Organization

The new roadmap flow should be placed in the `/(app)/` route group as it requires authentication. The structure should be:

```
/app/(app)/new-roadmap/
├── page.tsx           # Main new roadmap page
└── __tests__/         # TDD tests written first
    └── new-roadmap.test.tsx
```

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Routing Structure]

### Authentication Flow

Based on the prototype and requirements:

1. User arrives at the site (unauthenticated)
2. Middleware redirects to `/login`
3. After successful authentication, new users are redirected to `/new-roadmap`
4. Returning users can access `/new-roadmap` to create additional roadmaps
   [Source: architecture/6-core-workflows.md#1. New User Registration & First Roadmap Creation]

### Component Architecture

All components should follow the established patterns:

- Use `React.forwardRef` for all components
- Define TypeScript interfaces extending appropriate HTML attributes
- Use `cn()` utility from `/lib/utils` for combining Tailwind classes
- Components go in `/components/features/new-roadmap/` for feature-specific components
  [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]

### UI Implementation from Prototype

Key UI elements from `prototypes/onboarding.html`:

- **Header**: Simple with "LattixIQ" branding
- **Question Title**: Adapts based on `localStorage.getItem('hasCompletedOnboarding')`
- **Category Buttons**: Instead of selection, buttons populate starter text in the goal input
- **How It Works**: Green gradient background, collapsible with smooth transitions
- **Goal Input**: Textarea with auto-resize, real-time validation feedback
- **Submit Button**: Green gradient with hover effects and loading state
- **Success Overlay**: Rocket emoji with fade/slide animation

**Category Button Behavior**: When clicked, category buttons should clear the current input and populate it with starter text that users can then customize. This provides inspiration while maintaining flexibility.
[Source: prototypes/onboarding.html]

### State Management Approach

Follow the hierarchical state management strategy:

1. Local Component State: Use `useState` for form inputs and UI state
2. Global State: Create Zustand store for loading state and user status
3. LocalStorage: Track user status with 'hasCompletedOnboarding' flag (temporary implementation)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The localStorage implementation for checking onboarding status is temporary. In future development (Story 1.5), this should be replaced with a proper database query to check if the user has any saved roadmaps. Add a TODO comment in the code to track this technical debt.
[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#State Management]

### TDD Approach

Following Test-Driven Development:

1. Write tests FIRST before implementation
2. Tests should cover all acceptance criteria
3. Use Vitest + React Testing Library for integration tests
4. Mock Supabase auth using Mock Service Worker (MSW)
5. Run tests frequently during development to ensure they pass
   [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Testing Philosophy]

### Styling and Responsiveness

- Use Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS variables for theming
- Match styling from prototype (green gradients, animations)
- Ensure all components work on mobile devices
- Test on various screen sizes during development
  [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#Frontend Stack]

### Previous Story Context

From Story 0.7, comprehensive documentation was created including:

- Code style guide with TypeScript conventions
- Testing strategy emphasizing TDD for new features
- Component patterns documented
  These standards should be followed when implementing the new roadmap UI.

### Testing

Following TDD approach, tests must be written FIRST:

- Test file location: `/app/(app)/new-roadmap/__tests__/new-roadmap.test.tsx`
- Use Vitest + React Testing Library for integration tests
- Mock Supabase auth and API calls using MSW
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Ensure tests cover all acceptance criteria before implementation
