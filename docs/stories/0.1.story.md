# Story 0.1: Initialize Next.js Project with TypeScript

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** a properly configured Next.js project  
**so that** I can begin building the application with type safety

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js 15+ project created with App Router
2. TypeScript configured with strict mode
3. ESLint and Prettier configured
4. Project runs locally with `npm run dev`
5. Initial README with setup instructions

  - [x] Add troubleshooting section
- [x] Task 6: Verify project structure alignment (AC: 1)
  - [x] Ensure directory structure follows the Unified Project Structure [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]
  - [x] Verify key directories exist: `/app`, `/components`, `/lib`, `/public`, `/tests`
  - [x] Create any missing directories per the project structure guide

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure

The project must follow the Unified Project Structure exactly as defined:

```
/lattixiq/
├── .github/workflows/         # CI/CD pipelines
├── .vscode/                   # VSCode settings
├── /app/                      # Next.js App Router
│   ├── /api/                  # API Routes
│   ├── /(app)/                # Protected routes
│   ├── /(auth)/               # Auth routes
│   ├── layout.tsx             # Root layout

### Technology Requirements

- **Next.js**: Version ~15.0.0 (must verify exact version)
- **TypeScript**: Version ~5.5.3 with strict mode enabled
- **React**: Version compatible with Next.js 15
- **Node.js**: Compatible version for Next.js 15
  [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]

### Coding Standards Implementation

- **Functional Programming**: All code must follow immutability and pure function principles
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `RoadmapCard.tsx`)
  - Functions/Variables: camelCase (e.g., `const userRoadmaps`)
  - Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., `interface RoadmapStep`)
- **ESLint**: Must be configured with strict rules for TypeScript, React, React Hooks, and Next.js
- **Prettier**: Must be set up for automatic formatting on save
  [Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md]

### Testing

- **Test Structure**: Tests will be organized in `/tests/` directory with subdirectories:
  - `/tests/unit/` - Unit tests using Vitest
  - `/tests/integration/` - Integration tests using Vitest and React Testing Library
  - `/tests/e2e/` - End-to-end tests using Playwright
- **Test File Naming**: All test files must follow `*.test.ts` convention
- **TDD Approach**: Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all new functionality

### Previous Story Insights

No previous story exists - this is the first story of the project.

### File Locations

Based on the Unified Project Structure, key configuration files should be located at:

- `/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `/.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration
- `/.prettierrc` - Prettier configuration
- `/next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration
- `/postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS configuration for Tailwind
- `/tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS configuration
