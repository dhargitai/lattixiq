# Story 0.5: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline with Netlify

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** development team  
**I want** automated testing and deployment  
**so that** we maintain code quality and can deploy reliably

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Actions workflow created for testing
2. Tests run on every PR
3. Linting and type checking automated
4. Netlify connected to GitHub repository
5. Main branch auto-deploys to production via Netlify

  - [ ] Configure Node.js version to match project (20)
  - [ ] Set up automatic deployments from main branch
- [ ] Task 5: Configure environment variables in Netlify (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` from Story 0.3
  - [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from Story 0.3
  - [ ] Add any additional production environment variables
  - [ ] Ensure environment variables are set for production context
- [ ] Task 6: Set up preview deployments (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Configure Netlify to create preview deployments for PRs
  - [ ] Verify preview deployments work correctly
  - [ ] Test that each PR gets a unique preview URL
  - [ ] Document preview deployment process for team

## Dev Notes

### CI/CD Architecture

- **GitHub Actions**: Runs tests and quality checks on every PR
- **Netlify**: Handles deployment to production and preview environments
- **Database Migrations**: Controlled separately, not auto-deployed
  [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#Deployment Strategy]

### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: "Continuous Integration"
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  ci-checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Checkout
      - Setup Node.js 20
      - Install Dependencies
      - Lint & Format Check
      - Run All Tests
      - Build Check
```

[Source: architecture/githubworkflowsciyaml.md]

### Environment Strategy

Three distinct environments:

1. **Development**: Local machine (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Preview**: Netlify preview deployments for PRs
3. **Production**: Live application on Netlify
   [Source: architecture/githubworkflowsciyaml.md#Environments]

### Test Environment Variables

For GitHub Actions tests:

- `TEST_SUPABASE_URL`: Test database URL
- `TEST_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Test database anon key
  These should be stored as GitHub repository secrets
  [Source: architecture/githubworkflowsciyaml.md#Run All Tests]

### Quality Gates

Pull requests cannot be merged unless all checks pass:

- Linting passes (enforces coding standards)
- All tests pass (unit, integration)
- Build succeeds
  [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#CI/CD Pipeline]

### Netlify Configuration

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `.next`
- Node version: 20
- Auto-deploy from main branch
- Preview deployments for all PRs
  [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#Deployment Strategy]

### Previous Story Context

- Story 0.1: Next.js project with npm scripts configured
- Story 0.3: Supabase environment variables available
- Story 0.4: Database migrations in `/supabase/migrations/`

### File Locations

- `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- Environment variables stored in:
  - GitHub Secrets (for Actions)
  - Netlify Environment Variables (for deployments)
    [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing

- Verify CI workflow runs on PR creation
- Ensure all steps pass with current codebase
- Test that failed tests block PR merge
- Confirm Netlify deploys on main branch merge
- Validate preview deployments work
