# Story 3.3: Settings Simplification

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user configuring reminder settings  
**I want** clear, concise interface text  
**So that** I can quickly understand and configure my preferences

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Remove "These settings apply to all your active plans" text from ReminderSettings
2. Ensure settings interface remains clear and understandable
3. Verify settings functionality is unchanged
4. Test settings across different screen sizes
5. Maintain proper spacing and layout after text removal

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Locate and modify ReminderSettings component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Navigate to `/components/shared/ReminderSettings.tsx` or `/components/features/settings/ReminderSettings.tsx`
  - [x] Locate the text "These settings apply to all your active plans"
  - [x] Remove the text element (likely a `<p>` or `<div>` tag)
  - [x] Check if the component has a `showDescription` prop that controls this text
  - [x] If prop exists, ensure it's set to false when component is used
- [x] Task 2: Verify settings clarity without description (AC: 2)
  - [x] Review remaining UI elements to ensure purpose is clear
  - [x] Confirm field labels adequately describe their function
  - [x] Check that any helper text or tooltips remain intact
- [x] Task 3: Test settings functionality (AC: 3)
  - [x] Test toggling reminder settings on/off
  - [x] Verify settings are saved correctly to database
  - [x] Confirm settings persist after page refresh
  - [x] Test that reminder preferences are applied correctly
- [x] Task 4: Test responsive layout (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Test on mobile viewport (375px)
  - [x] Test on tablet viewport (768px)
  - [x] Test on desktop viewport (1024px+)
  - [x] Verify spacing and padding are consistent after text removal
  - [x] Check that no layout shifts occur
- [x] Task 5: Update component usage across the app
  - [x] Search for all instances where ReminderSettings is imported
  - [x] Update any props passed to the component if needed
  - [x] Verify the component works correctly in all locations (PlanScreen, Settings page)
- [x] Task 6: Write unit tests for the changes
  - [x] Create or update test file at `/tests/unit/components/ReminderSettings.test.tsx`
  - [x] Test that the descriptive text is not rendered
  - [x] Test that settings functionality remains intact
  - [x] Verify component renders without errors

## Dev Notes

### Component Locations

- **Primary Location**: Component exists in two possible locations based on search results:
  - `/components/shared/ReminderSettings.tsx` [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md - shared components]
  - `/components/features/settings/ReminderSettings.tsx` [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md - feature components]
- **Usage Locations**: Component is used in:
  - PlanScreen component (`/components/features/roadmap/PlanScreen.tsx`)
  - Settings page (`/components/settings/NotificationSettings.tsx`)

### Frontend Architecture Pattern

- Shared components are reusable across features [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture]
- Feature components are specific to a single route/feature [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture]
- Components use TypeScript interfaces for props [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]

### UI Component Details

- Uses shadcn/ui base components [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md - UI Components: shadcn/ui v2.0.0]
- Styled with Tailwind CSS v4.0.0 [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md - Styling]
- Should follow the forwardRef pattern if refs are needed [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]

### Component Props Pattern

- Check for `showDescription` or similar prop that controls text visibility
- Props should be defined with TypeScript interface [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]
- Use optional props with `?` for non-required fields

### State Management

- Settings likely use Zustand store for global state [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md - State Management: Zustand]
- User preferences stored in database [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md - user_preferences table]

### Database Integration

- Settings saved to `user_preferences` table [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md - Database Schema Key Entities]
- Uses Supabase for data persistence [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md - Database: Supabase]

### Previous Story Context

- Part of EPIC-003 content management improvements
- Focused on simplifying MVP interface for better user experience

## Testing

### Test File Locations

- Unit tests: `/tests/unit/components/ReminderSettings.test.tsx`
- Integration tests may exist in: `/tests/integration/plan-modal-flow.test.tsx`

### Testing Standards

- Use Vitest for unit testing [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md - Test Types]
- Test with React Testing Library for component interaction [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md - Integration Tests]
- Include both happy and unhappy paths [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md - Happy and Unhappy Path Coverage]

### Specific Test Cases

```tsx
describe("ReminderSettings", () => {
  // Happy Path
  it("should render without descriptive text", () => {
    // Test that "These settings apply..." text is not present
  });

  it("should save settings correctly", () => {
    // Test that toggling settings updates the database
  });

  // Unhappy Path
  it("should handle database save errors gracefully", () => {
    // Test error handling when save fails
  });

  it("should maintain layout on all screen sizes", () => {
    // Test responsive behavior
  });
});
```

### Mock Requirements

- Mock Supabase client for database operations [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md - Mocked Services]
- Mock user authentication state
- Use MSW for API mocking if needed [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md - Sandboxed Test Environment]
