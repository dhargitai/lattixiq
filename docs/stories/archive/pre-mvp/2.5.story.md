```

**Data Models:** [Source: architecture/3-data-models.md]

```typescript
// Import types for reflection handling
import type {
  ApplicationLog,
  ApplicationLogInsert,
  RoadmapStep,
  RoadmapStepUpdate,
} from "@/lib/supabase/types";

// All database fields use snake_case naming
const reflection: ApplicationLogInsert = {
  user_id: userId,
  roadmap_step_id: stepId,
  situation_text: situationText,
  learning_text: learningText,
  effectiveness_rating: rating,
};
```

**Component Architecture:** [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md]

```typescript
// Follow three-tier component structure
/components/ui/star-rating.tsx          // Base rating component
/components/shared/ReflectionForm.tsx   // Reusable reflection form
/components/features/roadmap/           // Feature-specific components

// Component template pattern with forwardRef
const ReflectScreen = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, ReflectScreenProps>(
  ({ className, stepId, ...props }, ref) => {
    // Component logic
    return <div className={cn("reflect-container", className)} ref={ref} {...props} />;
  }
);
```

### Previous Story Context

**From Story 2.4 (Reminder Notification System):**

- Plan data is stored in roadmap_steps table with fields: plan_situation, plan_trigger, plan_action
- Users can navigate directly to reflect screen via deep links from notifications
- Database uses snake_case naming convention throughout
- Navigation flow established: Roadmap → Learn → Plan → Reflect
- Reflect screen is accessible when a plan exists for the current step

**From Story 2.3 (Plan Screen Context):**

- Plan creation saves data to roadmap_steps table
- Plan persistence enables direct navigation to reflect screen
- User can return to Learn screen from Reflect screen for concept review
- Form validation patterns established for user input

### Frontend Specification Alignment

**UI/UX Requirements:** [Source: docs/frontend-spec.md]

- Reflect Screen wireframe (Screen 4) shows structured layout:
  - Plan reminder section with saved plan context
  - "How did your plan go?" prompt
  - Large text area for reflection description
  - 5-star effectiveness rating
  - "Complete & Unlock Next Step" button
- Minimum character requirement (50 words) for thoughtful reflections
- Success animation and feedback on completion
- Back navigation to Learn screen available
- Serene Minimalist aesthetic with calming colors

**Prototype Implementation:** [Source: prototypes/reflect.html]

- Plan reminder section with green gradient background and target emoji
- Auto-resizing textarea with character counter
- Interactive star rating with hover effects and feedback messages
- Success overlay with celebration animation
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Progress indicator showing current step position
- Form validation preventing submission without required fields

### Project Structure Alignment

**Route Structure:** Matches defined App Router pattern

- `/app/(app)/roadmap/[roadmapId]/steps/[stepId]/reflect/page.tsx`
- Protected route requiring authentication via middleware.ts
- Dynamic routing for roadmap and step IDs

**Component Organization:** Follows three-tier structure

- Base components in `/components/ui/` (star-rating.tsx)
- Shared components in `/components/shared/` (ReflectionForm.tsx)
- Feature components in `/components/features/roadmap/`

**API Endpoints:** RESTful pattern in `/app/api/reflections/route.ts`

- POST for creating new reflections
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Authentication via Supabase middleware
