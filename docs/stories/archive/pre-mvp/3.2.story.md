## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.1 implementation:

- ActiveRoadmapCard component already created at `/components/features/toolkit/ActiveRoadmapCard.tsx`
- Basic structure and styling implemented matching prototype design
- Data fetching logic established in `/lib/db/toolkit.ts`
- Component currently shows placeholder data - needs enhancement with real roadmap details
- Responsive design already tested for mobile viewports

### Data Models

The following data models will be used [Source: architecture/3-data-models.md]:

**Roadmap** (`roadmaps` table):

- `id`: string - Primary key
- `user_id`: string - Foreign key to users
- `goal_description`: string | null - The user's goal
- `status`: 'active' | 'completed' | null - Current roadmap status
- `created_at`: string | null - Timestamp when created
- `completed_at`: string | null - Timestamp when completed

**RoadmapStep** (`roadmap_steps` table):

- `id`: string - Primary key
- `roadmap_id`: string - Foreign key to roadmaps
- `knowledge_content_id`: string - Foreign key to knowledge content
- `status`: 'locked' | 'unlocked' | 'completed' | null - Step status
- `order`: number - Step sequence (1-based)
- `plan_created_at`: string | null - When user created their plan

**KnowledgeContent** (`knowledge_contents` table):

- `id`: string - Primary key
- `title`: string - Mental model or bias name
- `type`: 'mental_model' | 'cognitive_bias' - Content type
- `description`: string | null - Brief description
- `content`: string | null - Full learning content

**ApplicationLog** (`application_logs` table):

- `id`: string - Primary key
- `user_id`: string - Foreign key to users
- `roadmap_step_id`: string - Foreign key to roadmap_steps
- `created_at`: string | null - Timestamp of reflection
- `effectiveness_rating`: number | null - User's rating (1-5)

### API Specifications

No new API endpoints required - will enhance existing Supabase client queries in `/lib/db/toolkit.ts` [Source: architecture/5-system-components.md#frontend-client].

Query pattern for fetching roadmap with steps:

```typescript
const { data: roadmap } = await supabase
  .from("roadmaps")
  .select(
    `
    *,
    roadmap_steps (
      *,
      knowledge_content (*)
    )
  `
  )
  .eq("user_id", userId)
  .eq("status", "active")
  .single();
```

### Component Specifications

Based on component architecture [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]:

Component location: `/components/features/toolkit/ActiveRoadmapCard.tsx`

Following the established component template pattern with:

- React.forwardRef for ref passing
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- cn utility for Tailwind class merging
- Proper loading states with Skeleton components

### Frontend Alignment

Based on prototype analysis [Source: prototypes/my-toolkit.html - active roadmap section]:

Visual specifications:

- Gradient background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #F7FAFC 0%, #EDF2F7 100%)`
- Border: 2px solid #E2E8F0
- "ACTIVE ROADMAP" badge in uppercase
- Arrow icon for navigation (→)
- Progress shown as "Step X of Y"
- Current step title displayed prominently
- "Continue Learning" button with primary styling

From roadmap.html prototype:

- Steps use color coding: completed (green), current (blue), locked (gray)
- Completion triggers celebration animation
- Progress automatically saves

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]:

- Component enhancement: `/components/features/toolkit/ActiveRoadmapCard.tsx`
- Data fetching updates: `/lib/db/toolkit.ts`
- Types imported from: `@/lib/supabase/types`
- Tests location: `/tests/integration/toolkit/active-roadmap.test.tsx`

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md]:

   - Shows X/Y steps format (not "Step X of Y" as per AC)
   - Percentage calculation working
   - Visual gradient on progress bar

4. **Time Tracking** ✓
   - formatTimeAgo function implemented
   - Handles various time ranges (hours, days, weeks, months)
   - "Just now", "Yesterday" special cases
   - Shows "No activity yet" for null dates

5. **Data Fetching** (Partial) ✓
   - getToolkitData function in toolkit.ts

   - Finds current unlocked step
   - Gets last activity from application_logs

6. **Basic Testing** ✓
   - Component tests in toolkit.test.tsx
   - Tests for display, navigation, time formatting
   - Mock data properly structured

#### ❌ Missing/Incomplete Features:

1. **Continue Learning Button** (AC 5) ✅ REVISED
   - Arrow button navigates to /roadmap page - APPROVED DESIGN
   - This allows users to see full roadmap context before continuing
   - Users can navigate to appropriate step from the roadmap view
   - Better UX than direct step navigation

2. **Step-Specific Navigation** (Task 3) ✅ REVISED
   - Navigation to /roadmap is intentional and correct
   - Step-specific navigation handled at the roadmap page level
   - This is a better separation of concerns

3. **Completion Celebration** (AC 6) ❌
   - No completion detection implemented
   - canvas-confetti not installed
   - No celebration UI or animations
   - No roadmap status update to 'completed'

4. **Multiple Roadmap States** (Task 5) ❌
   - No handling for paused state (>7 days inactive)
   - No special styling for near-completion
   - No "Resume" action variant

5. **Loading & Error States** (Task 7) ❌
   - No skeleton loader implemented
   - No error handling in component
   - No retry mechanism

6. **Step Status Badge** ❌
   - Current step shows title only
   - No "IN PROGRESS" or "READY TO START" badges

7. **Proper Step Format** ⚠️
   - Shows "3/7 steps" instead of "Step 3 of 7" as specified

#### 🔧 Code Quality Issues:

1. **Navigation Logic**
   - Hard-coded `/roadmap` navigation instead of dynamic routing
   - No consideration of step phase or state

2. **Type Safety**
   - plan_situation, plan_trigger, plan_action fields referenced but not in types
   - Missing proper type definitions for step phases

3. **Missing Integration Tests**
   - No tests for navigation logic
   - No tests for completion detection
   - No tests for error states
   - No dedicated test file at `/tests/integration/toolkit/active-roadmap.test.tsx`

#### 📊 Coverage Summary (REVISED):

| Category            | Completed | Total  | Percentage |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Acceptance Criteria | 5         | 6      | 83%        |
| Tasks/Subtasks      | 6         | 8      | 75%        |
| Integration Tests   | 0         | 1      | 0%         |
| **Overall**         | **11**    | **15** | **73%**    |

#### 🎯 Priority Recommendations (REVISED):

1. **HIGH**: Install canvas-confetti and implement completion celebration
2. **MEDIUM**: Add loading/error states with skeleton loader
3. **MEDIUM**: Handle multiple roadmap states (paused, near-completion)
4. **LOW**: Fix step format display to match specification ("Step X of Y")
5. **LOW**: Add step status badges ("IN PROGRESS", "READY TO START")

#### 💡 Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Refactor Navigation**: Create a `getStepNavigationPath` utility that determines the correct route based on step state
2. **Add Step State Machine**: Implement clear state transitions for steps (locked → unlocked → in_progress → completed)
3. **Enhance Types**: Add missing plan fields to RoadmapStep type definition
4. **Create Dedicated Test File**: Move tests to proper location with comprehensive coverage
5. **Add Storybook Stories**: Create stories for different roadmap states (active, paused, near-complete, completed)

### Verdict: **Mostly Complete** ✅ (73% Implementation)

**REVISED ASSESSMENT**: After clarification, the navigation design is actually correct and intentional. The arrow button leading to the Roadmap page provides better UX by showing users their full journey context before continuing to a specific step.

The component successfully displays active roadmap information with progress tracking and time-based insights. The main missing piece is the completion celebration feature. With that addition and some polish items (loading states, status badges), this story would be fully complete.

**Key Strengths:**

- Navigation pattern is well-designed (roadmap overview first)
- Core functionality working (progress, time tracking, data fetching)
- Visual design matches prototype specifications

**Remaining Work:**

- Completion celebration (high priority)
- Loading/error states
- Minor UI enhancements (step format, status badges)
