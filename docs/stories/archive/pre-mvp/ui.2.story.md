# Story UI.2: Implement Bottom Navigation Component

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user of the LattixIQ app
**I want** a persistent bottom navigation bar
**So that** I can easily access My Toolkit and Settings from anywhere in the app

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Bottom navigation bar appears on all app screens (except login/onboarding)
2. Navigation includes two items: "My Toolkit" and "Settings" with appropriate icons
3. Active state is clearly indicated with color and visual feedback
4. Navigation bar is fixed at bottom of viewport on mobile devices
5. Icons use lucide-react library for consistency
6. Smooth transitions occur when switching between tabs
7. Navigation respects authentication state (only shows for logged-in users)
8. Component is fully accessible with proper ARIA labels
9. Navigation bar adapts appropriately for tablet/desktop layouts

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Implement smooth transition animations
  - [ ] Ensure proper focus states for keyboard navigation

- [ ] Task 3: Integrate navigation into app layout (AC: 1, 4, 7, 9)
  - [ ] Update `/app/(app)/layout.tsx` to include BottomNavigation
  - [ ] Ensure navigation only renders for authenticated routes
  - [ ] Apply fixed positioning at bottom for mobile
  - [ ] Implement responsive behavior for tablet/desktop
  - [ ] Add proper z-index to stay above page content
  - [ ] Add padding to page content to account for navigation height

- [ ] Task 4: Update existing navigation patterns (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Remove or update any existing navigation components
  - [ ] Ensure all screens properly integrate with new navigation
  - [ ] Update page headers to work with bottom navigation
  - [ ] Test navigation flow from all screens

- [ ] Task 5: Write tests for navigation component (AC: 1-9)
  - [ ] Unit tests for BottomNavigation component
  - [ ] Test active state detection
  - [ ] Test authentication state handling
  - [ ] Integration tests for navigation between screens
  - [ ] Test responsive behavior
  - [ ] Test accessibility features

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This is part of the UI prototype alignment epic. The bottom navigation is a key missing component identified in the prototype review.

### Component Specifications

Based on PROTOTYPE_COMPONENT_MAPPING.md:

**Bottom Navigation** (multiple prototypes):

- Use `NavigationMenu` (horizontal variant) as base [Source: PROTOTYPE_COMPONENT_MAPPING.md#Bottom Navigation]
- Fixed positioning at bottom
- Active state indicators
- Icon + label layout
- Smooth transitions between tabs

From prototype files:

- Navigation appears in: my-toolkit.html, roadmap.html, settings.html
- Two items: "My Toolkit" (home icon) and "Settings" (gear icon)
- Active state shown with filled icon and text color change

### Frontend Alignment

From frontend-spec.md:

- "Bottom Navigation bar will serve as the primary menu" [Source: frontend-spec.md#About the menu]
- "Persistent, app-level navigation" [Source: frontend-spec.md#Component Library]
- "Will contain icon-based links to My Toolkit and Settings"
- "Minimalist and unobtrusive" styling

### File Locations

- New component: `/components/shared/BottomNavigation.tsx`
- Layout integration: `/app/(app)/layout.tsx`
- Icons: Use `lucide-react` package (Home, Settings icons)

### Technical Implementation Details

From architecture docs:

- Use Next.js App Router navigation hooks (`usePathname`) [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md]
- Follow component template pattern with forwardRef [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]
- Use `cn` utility for combining Tailwind classes [Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md]

Example structure based on architecture patterns:

```tsx
interface BottomNavigationProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> {
  // Props if needed
}

const BottomNavigation = React.forwardRef<HTMLElement, BottomNavigationProps>(
  ({ className, ...props }, ref) => {
    // Implementation
  }
);
BottomNavigation.displayName = "BottomNavigation";
```

### Testing

- Component tests: `/tests/unit/components/BottomNavigation.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `/tests/integration/navigation.test.tsx`
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Test authentication state handling
