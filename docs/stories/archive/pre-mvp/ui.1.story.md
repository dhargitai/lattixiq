# Story UI.1: Align Core Learning Loop Screens

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user navigating through the core learning loop
**I want** the Learn and Plan screens to match the prototype designs
**So that** I have a consistent and polished user experience

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Learn screen matches prototype styling with proper card layouts, typography, and spacing
2. Plan screen displays form fields with correct labels based on content type:
   - Mental Models: "IF" and "THEN I WILL" fields
   - Cognitive Biases/Fallacies: Adapted spotting mission fields
3. All screens use consistent card styling with soft rounded corners and subtle shadows
4. Form validation states match prototype patterns (error highlighting, success feedback)
5. Navigation between screens maintains consistent header and back button behavior
6. Loading and error states follow the established design patterns
7. Mobile responsive layouts match prototype breakpoints
8. All existing functionality continues to work correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This is a brownfield enhancement epic, so all existing functionality must be preserved while updating the UI.

### Component Specifications

Based on PROTOTYPE_COMPONENT_MAPPING.md:

**Learn Screen** (learn.html):

- Content Container: Use `Card` with `ScrollArea` [Source: PROTOTYPE_COMPONENT_MAPPING.md#Content Container]
- Custom typography for readability
- Focus mode styling
- Progress indicator integration

**Plan Screen** (plan.html):

- IF-THEN Form: Use `Form` with `Input` and `Textarea` [Source: PROTOTYPE_COMPONENT_MAPPING.md#IF-THEN Form Structure]
- Toggle Switches: Use `Switch` component with indigo theme
- Custom field grouping styling
- Validation states with `FormMessage`

### Frontend Alignment

From frontend-spec.md:

- "Serene Minimalist" aesthetic with generous white space [Source: frontend-spec.md#Core Design Principles]
- Card components with "soft, rounded corners and a very subtle border or shadow" [Source: frontend-spec.md#Component Library]
- Form validation with "minimum amount of text to be entered before Submit button is enabled" [Source: frontend-spec.md#Edge Cases & State Management]

### File Locations

Based on project structure:

- Learn screen: `/app/(app)/learn/[stepId]/page.tsx`
- Plan screen: `/app/(app)/plan/[stepId]/page.tsx`
- Shared components: `/components/ui/` and `/components/shared/`

### Technical Constraints

- Using shadcn/ui components (New York style) [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS variables [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled [Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md]

### Testing

- Integration tests location: `/tests/integration/` [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md]
- Use Vitest and React Testing Library [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md]
- Test both happy and unhappy paths [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md]
