  - [x] Ensure tests follow happy/unhappy path pattern [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Happy and Unhappy Path Coverage]
- [x] Task 6: Configure test scripts in package.json (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add `"test": "vitest"` for running all tests
  - [x] Add `"test:unit": "vitest run tests/unit"` for unit tests only
  - [x] Add `"test:integration": "vitest run tests/integration"` for integration tests
  - [x] Add `"test:e2e": "playwright test"` for E2E tests
  - [x] Add `"test:watch": "vitest watch"` for development

## Dev Notes

### Testing Philosophy

- **TDD Approach**: Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Testing Pyramid**: "Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration." - Kent C. Dodds
- **Coverage**: Both happy and unhappy paths must be tested
  [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Testing Philosophy]

### Technology Stack

- **Vitest**: v1.6.0 - Modern, fast test runner with in-memory mocking
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Playwright**: v1.45.0 - For E2E browser automation
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: For mocking external services
  [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]

### Test Organization

```
/tests
├── /unit/              # Pure business logic tests
├── /integration/       # Component and API route tests
└── /e2e/               # Full user flow tests
```

[Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Test Types and Organization]

### Integration Test Example Structure

```tsx
describe("POST /api/roadmaps", () => {
  // --- Happy Path ---
  it("should create a roadmap and return 201 for an authenticated user with a valid goal", () => {
    // Test logic here
  });

  // --- Unhappy Paths ---
  it("should return 401 Unauthorized if no user is logged in", () => {
    // Test logic here
  });

  it("should return 400 Bad Request if the goalDescription is missing or too short", () => {
    // Test logic here
  });
});
```

[Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Test Case Structure]

### Sandboxed Test Environment Requirements

- Mock all external services (Stripe, Notifications, AI)
- Use separate test database with `.env.test`
- Never use real API keys or credentials in tests
- Vitest's mocking for backend, MSW for frontend
  [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Sandboxed Test Environment]

### E2E Test Coverage for V1

Two critical flows must have E2E tests:

1. Complete User Registration & First Roadmap Creation flow
2. Full "Learn, Plan, Act, Reflect" loop for a single roadmap step
   [Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#End-to-End (E2E) Tests]

### Test File Naming Convention

- All test files must use `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` extension
- Match component/function names (e.g., `Button.test.tsx` for `Button.tsx`)
  [Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md#Naming Conventions]

### Previous Story Context

- Story 0.1: TypeScript and ESLint configured
- Story 0.2: shadcn/ui components available for testing
- Story 0.3: Authentication flow ready for E2E testing
- Story 0.5: CI pipeline will run these tests

### File Locations

- `/vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration
- `/playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `/lib/test-utils.ts` - Testing utilities
- `/tests/` - All test files
- `/.env.test` - Test environment variables (never commit)
  [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements

- Every new feature must have tests
- Tests must cover both success and failure scenarios
- Integration tests prioritized over unit tests
- Mocked services for all external dependencies
- Tests run in CI pipeline from Story 0.5
