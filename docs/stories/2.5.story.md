## üéØ REMAINING WORK - Critical Gaps to Address

### **Priority 1: Missing "What did you learn?" Field (AC4)**

- **Current State**: Single combined text area for all reflection text
- **Required**: Separate secondary text area for learning insights
- **Implementation**:
  - Add learning_text field to ReflectScreen component form
  - Update database operations to handle separate fields (schema already supports this)
  - Update UI to have two distinct text areas with appropriate labels
- **Story Points**: 2-3 hours of work

### **Priority 2: Auto-resizing Textarea (AC2)**

- **Current State**: Fixed-height textarea with `resize-none` class
- **Required**: Auto-expanding textarea based on content
- **Implementation**:
  - Remove `resize-none` class
  - Add auto-resize functionality via useEffect or ref callback
  - Test across different content lengths
- **Story Points**: 1-2 hours of work

### **Priority 3: Success Animation (AC6)**

- **Current State**: Navigation feedback only (`router.push("/roadmap?success=true")`)
- **Required**: Visual success animation/feedback
- **Implementation**:
  - Add success modal or toast notification
  - Consider celebration animation (confetti, checkmark, etc.)
  - Enhance user satisfaction for completing reflection
- **Story Points**: 2-3 hours of work

### **Implementation Summary**

- **Total Remaining Work**: ~5-8 hours
- **Current Completion**: ~85% of original story requirements
- **Architecture**: Current implementation actually exceeds story in robustness and testing

```

**Data Models:** [Source: architecture/3-data-models.md]

```typescript
// Import types for reflection handling
import type {
  ApplicationLog,
  ApplicationLogInsert,
  RoadmapStep,
  RoadmapStepUpdate,
} from "@/lib/supabase/types";

// All database fields use snake_case naming
const reflection: ApplicationLogInsert = {
  user_id: userId,
  roadmap_step_id: stepId,
  situation_text: situationText,
  learning_text: learningText,
  effectiveness_rating: rating,
};
```

**Component Architecture:** [Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md]

```typescript
// Follow three-tier component structure
/components/ui/star-rating.tsx          // Base rating component
/components/shared/ReflectionForm.tsx   // Reusable reflection form
/components/features/roadmap/           // Feature-specific components

// Component template pattern with forwardRef
const ReflectScreen = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, ReflectScreenProps>(
  ({ className, stepId, ...props }, ref) => {
    // Component logic
    return <div className={cn("reflect-container", className)} ref={ref} {...props} />;
  }
);
```

### Previous Story Context

**From Story 2.4 (Reminder Notification System):**

- Plan data is stored in roadmap_steps table with fields: plan_situation, plan_trigger, plan_action
- Users can navigate directly to reflect screen via deep links from notifications
- Database uses snake_case naming convention throughout
- Navigation flow established: Roadmap ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Reflect
- Reflect screen is accessible when a plan exists for the current step

**From Story 2.3 (Plan Screen Context):**

- Plan creation saves data to roadmap_steps table
- Plan persistence enables direct navigation to reflect screen
- User can return to Learn screen from Reflect screen for concept review
- Form validation patterns established for user input

### Frontend Specification Alignment

  - 5-star effectiveness rating
  - "Complete & Unlock Next Step" button
- Minimum character requirement (50 words) for thoughtful reflections
- Success animation and feedback on completion
- Back navigation to Learn screen available
