# Story UI.6: Align Reflect Screen with Prototype Design

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user completing a learning cycle
**I want** the reflect screen to match the prototype design while retaining the learning insights field
**So that** I have a visually consistent and engaging experience when logging my applications

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Reflect screen header matches prototype with back navigation and step indicator
2. Main content container uses prototype card styling with proper shadows and border radius (16px)
3. Plan reminder card displays with green gradient background and left border accent
4. "Describe what happened" textarea has prototype styling with focus states and character counter
5. "What did you learn?" field is retained and redesigned to match prototype aesthetics
6. Star rating section displays with:
   - Centered star layout with proper sizing (32px stars)
   - Hover animations with yellow fill transition
   - Descriptive text below stars based on selection
7. Submit button follows prototype primary button styling with proper states
8. Success dialog matches prototype celebration pattern with confetti animation
9. All form validation and error states follow prototype patterns
10. Mobile responsive layout maintains visual hierarchy
11. Smooth animations on interactions (textarea resize, star hover, button states)
12. All existing functionality continues to work correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From UI stories 1-5:

- Global CSS utilities in `/app/globals.css` work well for prototype styles
- Component updates should maintain backward compatibility
- Integration tests need updates to match new UI text
- Animations should use CSS for performance
- Consider extracting common patterns into reusable components

### Component Specifications

Based on PROTOTYPE_COMPONENT_MAPPING.md:

**Reflect Page** (reflect.html):

- Form Container: Use `Card` with custom styling
- Text Areas: Use `Textarea` with enhanced focus states
- Rating Component: Custom star rating with `Button` components
- Success Modal: Use `Dialog` with custom animations
- Plan Reminder: Use `Card` with gradient background

### Visual Design Reference

From prototype (reflect.html):

- Background: #FAFBFC
- Card background: White with 16px border radius
- Primary green: #48BB78
- Primary blue: #4299E1
- Text colors: #1A202C (headings), #2D3748 (body), #718096 (muted)
- Shadows: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)
- Border colors: #E2E8F0 (default), #48BB78 (focus)
- Spacing: 32px between major sections, 24px within sections

### File Locations

- Reflect screen component: `/components/features/roadmap/ReflectScreen.tsx`
- Global styles: `/app/globals.css`
- UI components: `/components/ui/`
- Tests: `/app/(app)/reflect/__tests__/` (if exists)

### Technical Constraints

- Maintain all existing functionality
- Use shadcn/ui components where applicable
- Follow Tailwind CSS v4 conventions
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Preserve all existing props and data flow

### Implementation Priorities

1. Visual consistency with prototype design
2. Retention and enhancement of "What did you learn?" field
3. Smooth animations and transitions
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. Accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Special Considerations

- The "What did you learn?" field is not in the prototype but is a valuable feature that should be retained and enhanced
- Consider making this field more prominent with visual cues to encourage reflection
- The field could be styled as a "bonus insights" or "deeper reflection" section
- Animation timing should be consistent with other screens (0.3s-0.5s durations)
