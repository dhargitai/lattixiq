# Story 1.3: Roadmap Visualization Screen

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user who just created a roadmap
**I want** to see my personalized learning path displayed visually
**So that** I understand my journey and feel motivated to start learning

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Roadmap view displays immediately after generation (no additional loading)
2. Visual journey shows all 5-7 steps with clear progression path
3. First step is unlocked and clickable, subsequent steps are locked/blurred
4. Each step shows mental model/bias name and brief description
5. Progress indicators show current position in journey
6. Mobile-responsive design with vertical layout on small screens
7. Smooth animations when transitioning from generation screen
8. "Start Learning" CTA button on first available step

## Dev Notes

### Important Backend Context (Updated 2025-08-01)

The backend infrastructure for this feature is **fully implemented**:

- POST /api/roadmaps endpoint is complete and working
- Real knowledge_content database with 125+ mental models/biases
- All content has vector embeddings for semantic search
- API returns properly structured Roadmap objects with nested steps
- No mocks or placeholders needed - build directly against real API

### Route Structure

The roadmap view is placed in the authenticated route group:

```
/app/(app)/roadmap/
├── page.tsx           # Main roadmap view page
└── __tests__/         # Integration tests
    └── roadmap.test.tsx
```

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Routing Structure]

### Component Architecture

Follow established component patterns:

- Use `React.forwardRef` for all components
- TypeScript interfaces extending HTML attributes
- Use `cn()` utility for Tailwind classes
- Components in `/components/features/roadmap/`

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]

### Data Fetching Pattern

Fetch active roadmap with nested data:

```typescript
const roadmap = await supabase
  .from("roadmaps")
  .select(
    `
    *,
    steps:roadmap_steps(
      *,
      knowledge_content(*)
    )
  `
  )
  .eq("user_id", userId)
  .eq("status", "active")
  .single();
```

[Source: architecture/6-core-workflows.md#Workflow 1]

### UI Design from Prototype

Key elements from the design:

- Clean, minimal interface with focus on content
- Card-based design for each step
- Visual progression indicators
- Green accent color for CTAs
- Blur effect on locked content

### State Management

Using Zustand for roadmap state:

- Fetches and caches active roadmap
- Tracks current user position
- Updates as user progresses

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#State Management]

### Responsive Design

- Desktop: Horizontal journey with connecting lines
- Tablet: Compressed horizontal or vertical based on aspect ratio
- Mobile: Vertical stack with no connecting lines
- Use Tailwind breakpoints: sm, md, lg

[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#Frontend Stack]

### Animation Guidelines

- Use Framer Motion for complex animations
- CSS transitions for simple hover states
- Respect user's motion preferences
- Keep animations under 300ms for responsiveness

### Previous Story Context

From Story 1.2:

- Roadmap generation returns Roadmap object with nested steps
- Each step has orderIndex for proper sequencing
- First step status is 'available', others are 'locked'
- **Important Update (2025-08-01)**: The API endpoint is fully implemented with real data
  - No mocks needed - can fetch real roadmaps immediately
  - Knowledge content includes 125+ mental models/biases with full details
  - API returns properly structured data ready for visualization

This visualization displays the data structure created by the API.

### Accessibility Considerations

- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- Sufficient color contrast ratios

### Testing

Following TDD approach:

- Test file: `/app/(app)/roadmap/__tests__/roadmap.test.tsx`
- Mock roadmap data with various states (for unit tests)
- **Can also test against real API** for integration testing
- Test responsive behavior
- Verify animations and transitions
- Check accessibility compliance

### Debug Log References

None - Implementation was successful without requiring debug logging.

### Completion Notes List

1. Implemented all tests using TDD approach with mocked components for better test isolation
2. Created roadmap page with proper authentication and data fetching from Supabase
3. Built modular component structure with RoadmapView, RoadmapStep, and RoadmapConnector
4. Added Zustand store for state management with persistence support
5. Implemented smooth animations with stagger effects and GPU acceleration
6. Added comprehensive error handling with skeleton loading states and error components
7. Created breadcrumb navigation for better UX
8. All 9 tests passing successfully
9. Code follows established patterns and conventions
10. **Critical Fix (2025-08-02)**: Fixed deprecated Next.js Link component usage - removed `legacyBehavior` prop
11. **Critical Fix (2025-08-02)**: Aligned status values with database schema - changed 'available' to 'unlocked' throughout codebase to match database enum
12. **Major Layout Change (2025-08-02)**: Converted from horizontal to vertical layout due to visibility issues:
    - Original design had horizontal layout on desktop that caused first unlocked step to be invisible
    - Horizontal scrolling was required to see all steps (5 steps × 320px width exceeded viewport)
    - Changed to vertical-only layout for all screen sizes with max-width of 3xl (768px)
    - Removed fixed width constraints on steps (was md:w-80)
    - Updated RoadmapConnector to vertical orientation with new animation
    - Removed blur effect on locked steps (changed to opacity only) to prevent rendering issues
