# Story 1.2: AI-Powered Roadmap Generation

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** new or returning user
**I want** the app to analyze my goal and generate a personalized learning roadmap
**So that** I receive a curated path of mental models and biases most relevant to my specific challenge

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Goal text is converted to vector embedding using Vercel AI SDK
2. Semantic search performs cosine similarity against pre-embedded KnowledgeContent
3. System selects top 5-7 most relevant mental models/biases
4. Algorithm prioritizes foundational concepts first in the roadmap order
5. API endpoint creates Roadmap and RoadmapStep records in database
6. Error handling for AI service failures with user-friendly messages
7. Temporary mock implementation until KnowledgeContent is seeded
8. Response time under 5 seconds for roadmap generation

  - [ ] Return created Roadmap with nested RoadmapSteps
- [ ] Task 5: Add temporary mock data for development (AC: 7)

  - [ ] Include at least 20 diverse mental models/biases covering:
    - Decision making (First Principles, Inversion)
    - Productivity (Parkinson's Law, 80/20 Rule)
    - Psychology (Confirmation Bias, Dunning-Kruger)
    - Systems thinking (Second-Order Thinking, Feedback Loops)
  - [ ] Each mock should have embedding-ready text fields
  - [ ] Add environment variable `USE_MOCK_CONTENT=true` for toggle
- [ ] Task 6: Implement error handling and monitoring (AC: 6, 8)
  - [ ] Add try-catch blocks with specific error types

  - [ ] Test with various goal inputs
  - [ ] Confirm response times meet performance criteria

## Dev Notes

### AI Service Architecture

The AI service will use Vercel AI SDK for embeddings generation. Key implementation details:

**File Locations:**

- AI service: `/lib/ai/roadmap-generator.ts`
- Embeddings utilities: `/lib/ai/embeddings.ts`
- Type definitions: `/lib/types/ai.ts`
- API endpoint: `/app/api/roadmaps/route.ts`

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#AI Service Organization]

### Semantic Search Implementation

The semantic search will use pgvector for cosine similarity:

1. Convert user goal to embedding using Vercel AI SDK
2. Query KnowledgeContent table using pgvector similarity operator
3. Order results by relevance score
4. Apply business logic for foundational concept prioritization

**Database Query Pattern:**

```sql
SELECT id, title, type,
       1 - (embedding <=> $1::vector) as similarity
FROM knowledge_content
WHERE 1 - (embedding <=> $1::vector) > 0.5
ORDER BY similarity DESC
LIMIT 7;
```

[Source: architecture/3-data-models.md#Vector Database Integration]

### API Endpoint Specification

**POST /api/roadmaps**

- Request: `{ "goalDescription": "string" }`
- Response (201): Roadmap object with nested RoadmapStep array
- Authentication: Required (Supabase JWT)

[Source: architecture/4-api-specification.md#Resource: Roadmaps]

### Data Models

**Roadmap:**

```typescript
interface Roadmap {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  goalDescription: string;
  status: "active" | "completed" | "archived";
  createdAt: string;
  completedAt?: string;
  steps?: RoadmapStep[];
}
```

**RoadmapStep:**

```typescript
interface RoadmapStep {
  id: string;
  roadmapId: string;
  knowledgeContentId: string;
  orderIndex: number;
  status: "locked" | "available" | "planned" | "completed";
  // ... other fields
}
```

[Source: architecture/3-data-models.md#2. Roadmap]

### Temporary Mock Implementation

Since KnowledgeContent needs to be seeded (future story), we'll implement a mock:

1. Hardcoded list of mental models with pre-calculated "embeddings"
2. Simple relevance matching based on keywords
3. Environment variable to toggle mock vs real implementation
4. Clear TODO comments for replacement

This allows frontend development to proceed while content seeding happens in parallel.

### Error Handling Patterns

Follow the established error handling strategy:

- Use custom error classes extending base ApplicationError
- Include error codes for client handling
- Log full context server-side
- Return sanitized messages to client

[Source: architecture/13-error-handling-strategy.md#API Routes Error Handling]

### Previous Story Context

From Story 1.1:

- New roadmap UI submits goal via form
- Loading state displays while roadmap generates
- Frontend expects Roadmap object with steps array
- Minimum 10 character validation on goal input

The API endpoint created in this story will be called by the form submission handler implemented in Story 1.1.

### Testing

Following TDD approach:

- Test file: `/app/api/roadmaps/__tests__/roadmaps.test.ts`
- Mock Vercel AI SDK responses
- Mock Supabase client for database operations
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Performance tests for response time
