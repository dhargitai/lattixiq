2. **Tech Stack**: List from architecture docs
3. **Prerequisites**: Node.js 20, npm, Supabase CLI
4. **Setup Instructions**: Step-by-step guide

9. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Format

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY]

## Context

What is the issue we're facing?

## Decision

What have we decided to do?

## Consequences

What are the positive and negative outcomes?
```

### Code Style Documentation

Must include:

- **Functional Programming**: Immutability and pure functions
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode requirements
- **Naming Conventions**: Components, functions, types, files
- **Component Patterns**: Template from frontend architecture
- **Testing Standards**: TDD approach
  [Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md]

### API Documentation Template

Each endpoint should document:

- HTTP method and path
- Description
- Authentication requirements
- Request body schema
- Response format
- Error responses
- Example requests/responses
  [Source: architecture/4-api-specification.md]

### Contributing Guidelines Content

- Git workflow (feature branches, PR process)
- Commit message format
- Code review process
- Testing requirements
- Documentation requirements
- How to report issues
- Development setup

### Previous Story Context

All previous stories have created the foundation that needs documenting:

- Story 0.1: TypeScript and linting setup
- Story 0.2: UI component system
- Story 0.3: Authentication setup
- Story 0.4: Database schema
- Story 0.5: CI/CD pipeline
- Story 0.6: Testing infrastructure

### Quality Checks

Documentation should be:

- Clear and concise
- Include concrete examples
- Be kept up-to-date with code
- Follow markdown best practices
- Include links to related docs

### Testing

- Verify all setup steps work on fresh clone
- Test that documented commands execute correctly
- Ensure links in documentation are valid
- Validate code examples compile/run
