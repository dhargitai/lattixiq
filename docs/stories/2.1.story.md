# Story 2.1: Learn Screen - Display Mental Model/Bias Content

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user who clicked on an unlocked roadmap step
**I want** to see clear, actionable information about the mental model or cognitive bias
**So that** I can understand the concept and prepare to apply it in my life

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Shows mental model/bias title, category, and type prominently
3. Displays concise summary (2-3 sentences) at the top
4. Shows detailed description in an easy-to-read format
5. Presents practical application guidance clearly
6. Mobile-responsive design with proper text sizing
7. "Continue to Plan" button at bottom to proceed to next step
8. Back navigation to return to roadmap view
9. Loading state while content fetches
10. Error handling if content fails to load

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.3 (Roadmap Visualization):

- Roadmap steps use status: 'locked' | 'unlocked' | 'completed'
- First step is 'unlocked', others are 'locked' by default
- Click handler on RoadmapStep navigates to learning screen
- Using Zustand for roadmap state management
- Vertical layout used for all screen sizes (max-width 3xl)
- **Important:** All code uses snake_case database fields directly (e.g., `step.knowledge_content_id`)

### Route Structure

The learn screen uses dynamic routing:

```text
/app/(app)/learn/[stepId]/
├── page.tsx           # Main learn page
└── __tests__/         # Integration tests
    └── learn.test.tsx
```

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Routing Structure]

### Component Architecture

Follow established patterns:

- Use `React.forwardRef` for all components
- TypeScript interfaces extending HTML attributes
- Use `cn()` utility for Tailwind classes
- Place in `/components/features/roadmap/`

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]

### Data Models

Import the actual database types from the auto-generated file:

```typescript
import type { KnowledgeContent, RoadmapStep, RoadmapStepStatus } from "@/lib/supabase/types";
```

**Important:** All database fields use **snake_case** naming:

```typescript
// Actual database structure for KnowledgeContent:
type KnowledgeContent = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  category: string | null;
  type: "mental-model" | "cognitive-bias" | "fallacy";
  summary: string | null;
  description: string | null;
  application: string | null;
  keywords: string[] | null;
  embedding: string | null;
};

// Actual database structure for RoadmapStep:
type RoadmapStep = {
  id: string;
  roadmap_id: string; // NOT roadmapId
  knowledge_content_id: string; // NOT knowledgeContentId
  status: "locked" | "unlocked" | "completed" | null;
  order: number;
  plan_situation: string | null; // NOT planSituation
  plan_trigger: string | null; // NOT planTrigger
  plan_action: string | null; // NOT planAction
  plan_created_at: string | null; // NOT planCreatedAt
};
```

**Extended type for UI components:**

```typescript
// Common pattern for nested data
interface RoadmapStepWithContent extends RoadmapStep {
  knowledge_content: KnowledgeContent;
}
```

[Source: architecture/3-data-models.md#Type System Overview]

### UI Design Guidelines

From prototype analysis:

- Clean, minimal interface with focus on readability
- Card-based layouts with subtle shadows
- Green accent color (#10b981) for CTAs
- Proper typography hierarchy:
  - Titles: text-2xl font-bold
  - Section headers: text-lg font-semibold
  - Body text: text-base with proper line-height

### State Management

Update existing Zustand store:

- Track current step and knowledge content
- Cache data for offline support
- Clear state on navigation away

[Source: architecture/8-frontend-architecture.md#State Management]

### Testing Requirements

Following TDD approach:

- Test file: `/app/(app)/learn/__tests__/learn.test.tsx`
- Use Vitest + React Testing Library
- Mock Supabase data fetching
- Test both happy and unhappy paths
- Focus on integration tests

[Source: architecture/11-testing-strategy.md#Testing Philosophy]

### Accessibility Considerations

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA)

### File Locations

**To be created:**

- `/app/(app)/learn/[stepId]/page.tsx` - Dynamic learn page
- `/components/features/roadmap/LearnScreen.tsx` - Main component
- `/app/(app)/learn/__tests__/learn.test.tsx` - Integration tests

**To be modified:**

- `/lib/stores/roadmap-store.ts` - Add learn screen state
- `/components/features/roadmap/RoadmapStep.tsx` - Ensure navigation works

### Technical Constraints

- Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router
- React 19.1.0
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS v4.0.0
- shadcn/ui v2.0.0 components

[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#Frontend Stack]

### Testing

Following Testing Strategy:

- **Integration Tests**: Primary focus for UI components
- **Unit Tests**: Only for complex isolated logic
- Test location: Colocated in `__tests__` directories
- Mock external dependencies (Supabase)
- Test user interactions and state changes
