## Development Recommendations

1. **Start with Epic 0** - No feature work should begin until infrastructure is complete
2. **Sequential Development** - Each epic builds on the previous one
3. **MVP First** - Complete Epics 0-3 before considering premium features
4. **User Testing** - Conduct user testing after Epic 2 to validate core loop
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Deferred to Epic 5 post-launch for real user data

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Database Scale**: Design schema with growth in mind

### Product Risks
- **User Engagement**: Validate core loop effectiveness after Epic 2
- **Premium Conversion**: Research pricing before Epic 4
- **Content Quality**: Ensure mental models data is accurate and actionable
