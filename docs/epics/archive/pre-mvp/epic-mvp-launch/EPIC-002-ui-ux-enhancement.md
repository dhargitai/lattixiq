# Epic 002: UI/UX Enhancement & Standardization

**Epic ID:** EPIC-002  
**Title:** Dynamic Textarea Focus States and CTA Button Standardization  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Epic Owner:** Frontend Team  
**Business Value:** Improved user experience, consistent interface design

## Epic Summary

Enhance user interface consistency and feedback by implementing dynamic textarea focus states that provide visual cues about input requirements, and standardizing Call-to-Action (CTA) button styles across all key user flows.

## Business Justification

- **User Experience:** Clear visual feedback helps users understand input requirements
- **Interface Consistency:** Standardized buttons create cohesive brand experience
- **User Guidance:** Dynamic states guide users toward successful task completion
- **Professional Polish:** Consistent styling improves perceived product quality

## User Stories

### Story 2.1: Dynamic Textarea Focus States

**As a** user completing the Plan screen  
**I want** visual feedback about my input progress  
**So that** I know when I've provided sufficient detail for my plan

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Plan screen IF textarea shows blue focus until 50+ characters, then green
- [ ] Plan screen THEN textarea shows blue focus until 50+ characters, then green
- [ ] Focus state transitions are smooth and visually appealing
- [ ] Character count logic is consistent with Reflect screen implementation
- [ ] Accessibility standards maintained for focus indicators

### Story 2.2: Standardized CTA Buttons

**As a** user navigating the application  
**I want** consistent button styling across all screens  
**So that** I have a cohesive and professional experience

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Create centralized CTA button component/utility
- [ ] Apply consistent styling to /new-roadmap screen buttons
- [ ] Apply consistent styling to /learn screen buttons
- [ ] Apply consistent styling to /plan screen buttons
- [ ] Apply consistent styling to /reflect screen buttons
- [ ] Maintain hover states, gradients, and sizing consistency
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works across all screen sizes

### Story 2.3: Enhanced Helper Accessibility

**As a** user seeking help  
**I want** the help icon to be easily visible and accessible  
**So that** I can quickly get assistance when needed

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Increase HelpCircle icon size from h-5 w-5 to h-6 w-6
- [ ] Maintain proper spacing and alignment in AppHeader
- [ ] Ensure icon remains accessible and meets contrast requirements
- [ ] Test on mobile devices for touch accessibility

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Dynamic Focus States**
   - Extend existing character count logic from ReflectScreen
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes for smooth transitions
   - Implement state management for character counting
   - Create reusable hook: `useDynamicFocusState(minLength: number)`

2. **CTA Button Standardization**
   - Create `StandardCTAButton` component or utility class
   - Define consistent gradient, padding, and hover states
   - Update existing buttons to use new standard
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition

3. **Helper Icon Enhancement**
   - Simple className update in AppHeader component
   - Verify responsive behavior maintained
   - Test accessibility with screen readers

### Design Specifications

**Focus State Colors:**

- Blue focus: `focus:border-blue-500 focus:ring-blue-200`
- Green focus: `focus:border-green-500 focus:ring-green-200`
- Transition: `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out`

**CTA Button Standard:**

- Gradient: `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-blue-600`
- Hover: `hover:from-blue-600 hover:to-blue-700`
- Shadow: `shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl`
- Padding: `px-6 py-3`
- Font: `font-semibold text-white`

## Dependencies

- Existing character count logic in ReflectScreen
- Current button implementations across target screens
- AppHeader component structure

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Dynamic focus states working on Plan screen textareas
- [ ] All CTA buttons using consistent styling
- [ ] Help icon increased in size with proper accessibility
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed
- [ ] Design review and approval completed

## Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk** - UI changes affect user experience directly

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Progressive rollout with feature flags
- A/B testing for button changes
- User feedback collection during beta testing
- Rollback plan for styling changes

## Estimated Effort

**Story Points:** 13  
**Development Time:** 2-3 days  
**Design Review:** 1 day  
**QA Time:** 1 day

## Acceptance Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. Type in Plan screen textareas and verify color transitions at 50 characters
2. Navigate through all target screens and verify button consistency
3. Test help icon visibility and click area on various devices
4. Verify keyboard navigation works properly
5. Test with screen readers for accessibility compliance

### Automated Testing

- Visual regression tests for button styling
- Unit tests for character counting logic
- Integration tests for focus state transitions
