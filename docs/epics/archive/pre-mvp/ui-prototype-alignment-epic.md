# Epic: UI/UX Prototype Alignment - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Align existing screen implementations with the established UI prototypes and frontend specifications to ensure consistency across the LattixIQ application while maintaining all current functionality.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context:

- Current relevant functionality: Core learning loop (Learn, Plan, Reflect screens), My Toolkit hub, Settings screen all functioning
- Technology stack: Next.js 15 with shadcn/ui components (New York style), Tailwind CSS v4
- Integration points: Supabase backend, existing navigation patterns, form submission logic

### Enhancement Details:

- What's being added/changed: Aligning UI components with prototype specifications, implementing missing navigation components, standardizing form patterns
- How it integrates: Following PROTOTYPE_COMPONENT_MAPPING.md guidelines, using existing shadcn/ui components with custom styling
- Success criteria: All screens match prototype designs, consistent navigation patterns, improved user experience without functionality regression

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Align Core Learning Loop Screens** - Update Learn, Plan, and Reflect screens to match prototype specifications including proper card styling, form layouts, and state transitions

2. **Story 2: Implement Bottom Navigation Component** - Add the missing bottom navigation bar with My Toolkit and Settings icons as shown in prototypes

3. **Story 3: Align Settings and My Toolkit Screens** - Update visual styling and component structure to match prototype wireframes

4. **Story 4: Standardize Form Patterns** - Update IF-THEN form labels, reminder settings, and validation states across Plan and Settings screens

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** UI changes could break existing functionality or create inconsistent states
- **Mitigation:** Implement changes incrementally with thorough testing of each screen
- **Rollback Plan:** Use git version control to revert individual component changes if needed

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features

## Story Manager Handoff:

Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Next.js 15 with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS v4
- Integration points: Existing Supabase backend APIs, current navigation patterns, form submission handlers
- Existing patterns to follow: shadcn/ui New York style, CSS variables for theming, mobile-first responsive design
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain all existing functionality, ensure no breaking changes to data flow
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering consistent UI/UX alignment with our prototypes as defined in frontend-spec.md and PROTOTYPE_COMPONENT_MAPPING.md.
