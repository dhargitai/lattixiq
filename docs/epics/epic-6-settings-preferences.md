## Epic Description

### Business Context

The Settings & User Preferences epic provides users with control over their LattixIQ experience, enabling personalization of reminders, notifications, privacy settings, and account management. This epic is essential for user retention and engagement by allowing users to tailor the app to their individual learning style and schedule.

### User Problem

Users need a centralized location to:

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components

- Settings screen main container (`/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx`)
- Settings section components (`/components/settings/`)
- Shared form components from UI library
- Toast notifications for success/error states

### Backend Requirements

- User preferences API endpoints
- Notification service integration
- Data export functionality
- Subscription management (Stripe integration)
- Audit logging for sensitive changes

### Data Model

```typescript
interface UserPreferences {
  userId: string;
  notifications: {
    enabled: boolean;
    dailyReminderTime: string;
    frequency: "daily" | "weekdays" | "custom";
    emailEnabled: boolean;
    pushEnabled: boolean;
  };
  theme: "light" | "dark" | "system";
  accessibility: {
    fontSize: "small" | "medium" | "large";
    highContrast: boolean;
    reduceMotion: boolean;
  };
  privacy: {
    analyticsEnabled: boolean;
    dataRetention: number; // days
  };
  learning: {
    difficulty: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced";
    pace: "intensive" | "moderate" | "relaxed";
  };
}
```

### Security Considerations

- Require password confirmation for sensitive changes
- Rate limiting on settings updates
- Audit trail for account changes
- Secure data export with authentication
- HTTPS only for all settings operations

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- Authentication system (Epic 0)
- Notification service (Epic 2)
- User profile data model
- Stripe integration for subscriptions
- Analytics service

### External Dependencies

- Push notification services (Firebase/OneSignal)
- Email service (SendGrid/AWS SES)
- Payment processor (Stripe)
- Export libraries (json2csv)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Platform-specific notification handling

**Impact:** High
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Use cross-platform notification service, test extensively on iOS/Android

### Risk 2: Data export compliance requirements

**Impact:** Medium
**Probability:** Low
**Mitigation:** Implement GDPR-compliant export formats, consult legal for requirements

### Risk 3: Settings sync conflicts

**Impact:** Medium
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Implement optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution

## Design & UX Considerations

### Design Principles

- Clear labeling and descriptions
- Immediate feedback for changes
- Undo capability for destructive actions
- Consistent with overall app design system

### Prototype References

## Epic Status Updates

| Date       | Status  | Notes                   |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| 2025-08-06 | Created | Initial epic definition |

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement biometric authentication for sensitive settings?
2. What level of notification customization do we want (per feature vs global)?
3. Do we need offline settings sync capability?
4. Should settings changes trigger re-onboarding for major changes?
5. What analytics should we track on settings usage?
