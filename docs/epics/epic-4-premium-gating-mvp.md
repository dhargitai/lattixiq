# Epic 4: Premium Gating & Testimonials (MVP)

## Epic Overview

**Title:** Basic Premium Gating After First Roadmap
**Priority:** High - Core MVP functionality
**Estimated Duration:** 1 sprint (2 weeks)
**Dependencies:** Epics 1-3 must be complete (need roadmap completion flow)

## Epic Description

Implement basic premium gating that allows users to complete their first roadmap for free, then requires subscription for additional roadmaps. Includes testimonial feature that grants one additional roadmap as a reward for leaving feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can create and complete one roadmap without subscription
- [ ] After first roadmap completion, users see subscription CTA instead of "Create New Roadmap"
- [ ] /new-roadmap, /learn/_, /plan/_, /reflect/\* paths redirect to /toolkit if user has roadmaps but no subscription
- [ ] Testimonial modal offers one additional roadmap for feedback
- [ ] Payment flow integrated with Stripe
- [ ] Subscription status properly tracked and enforced

## User Stories

### Story 4.1: Implement Stripe Payment Integration

**As a** user  
**I want** to upgrade to premium  
**So that** I can create additional roadmaps after my first one

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Checkout callback path handles subscription verification
- [ ] Subscription status tracked in database
- [ ] Success/failure messages displayed on toolkit page after checkout
- [ ] Webhook handling for subscription lifecycle events

**Technical Tasks:**

1. Install latest Stripe SDK: `npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-js@latest`
2. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```env
   # Stripe configuration (values to be populated by product owner)
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[your-stripe-secret-key]
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[your-stripe-publishable-key]
   STRIPE_MONTHLY_PRODUCT_ID=[your-monthly-product-id]
   STRIPE_ANNUAL_PRODUCT_ID=[your-annual-product-id]
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=[your-webhook-secret]
   ```
3. Implement `/app/api/checkout/route.ts`:
   - Create Stripe checkout session with product ID from env
   - Set success_url to `/api/checkout/callback?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
   - Set cancel_url to `/toolkit?canceled=true`
4. Implement `/app/api/checkout/callback/route.ts`:
   - Verify checkout session with Stripe
   - Update user subscription status in database

6. Add to user profile schema:
   ```sql
   - stripe_customer_id

   - subscription_status (active/canceled/past_due)
   - subscription_current_period_end
   ```
7. Create `/lib/stripe/client.ts` and `/lib/stripe/utils.ts` for helper functions

   - content (text) -- markdown content
   - metadata (jsonb, nullable) -- optional structured data
   - created_at (timestamp)

   - listContentBlocks() // for admin purposes
   ```
8. Add route guards to `/app/(app)/new-roadmap/page.tsx`:
   - Check subscription limits
   - Redirect to `/toolkit` with query param if not allowed
9. Update database schema for user stats:
   ```sql
   - roadmap_count in user profiles
   - free_roadmaps_used boolean

## Epic Summary

**Total Story Points:** 34 (reduced from 71)
**Critical Path:** Payment integration (4.1) ‚Üí Premium gates (4.2) ‚Üí Testimonial system (4.3) ‚Üí Settings integration (4.4)
**Risk Areas:**

- Payment integration testing
- Edge cases in gating logic
- Testimonial system abuse prevention
- Webhook reliability

**Success Metrics:**

- 30% of users complete first roadmap
- 20% leave testimonials for bonus roadmap
- 15% convert to paid after first roadmap
- 0% can exploit system for unlimited free roadmaps

**Testing Requirements:**

- Payment flow end-to-end testing with Stripe test mode
- Gate logic with various user states
- Testimonial submission and bonus granting
- Webhook event handling
- Subscription status synchronization
- Database content fetching and caching

**Implementation Notes:**

1. **Stripe Setup:**
   - Product IDs managed via environment variables
   - Products created directly in Stripe Dashboard
   - Monthly subscription as primary offering
   - Annual option available but not emphasized initially

2. **Premium CTA Flow:**
   - Dialog-based approach for better UX
   - Content stored in database for easy updates
   - Direct to Stripe checkout (no intermediate pricing page)
   - Success callback handles subscription verification

3. **Database-Driven Content:**
   - Generic `content_blocks` table for all dynamic content
   - Content identified by unique `content_id` slugs
   - Cached API endpoint for performance
   - Admin can update without deployment
   - Extensible for future content needs (testimonials, onboarding, etc.)

4. **User Experience:**
   - Clear value proposition in dialog
   - Smooth checkout ‚Üí callback ‚Üí toolkit flow
   - Status messages confirm subscription state
   - Settings page for subscription management

5. **Security Considerations:**
   - Webhook signature verification
   - Server-side subscription checks
   - No client-side subscription status trust

6. **Stripe Integration References:**
   - Use Context7 to get latest Stripe SDK patterns
   - Follow Stripe's Next.js integration guide
   - Implement proper error handling for all payment flows
   - Use Stripe Elements for PCI compliance if custom forms needed

7. **Content Blocks Usage Pattern:**

   ```typescript
   // Example usage in component
   const { data: content } = await fetch("/api/content-blocks/premium-benefits-modal");

   // Potential content_id values:
   // 'premium-benefits-modal' - Premium features list
   // 'testimonial-request-modal' - Testimonial prompt content
   // 'onboarding-welcome' - Welcome message for new users
   // 'roadmap-completion-congrats' - Completion celebration message
   // 'subscription-success' - Post-payment success message
   // 'subscription-canceled' - Cancellation confirmation
   ```
