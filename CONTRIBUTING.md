## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Exact steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Your environment details (OS, Node version, browser)

- A clear and descriptive title
- Step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
- Explanation of why this enhancement would be useful
- Possible implementation approach (if you have ideas)

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good-first-issue` - Simple issues perfect for beginners
- `help-wanted` - Issues where we need community help
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Add/update tests as needed
- Update documentation if required

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Check code quality
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Follow our [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new mental model component"
```

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-reflection-reminders`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/login-redirect-issue`)
- `docs/` - Documentation changes (e.g., `docs/update-api-guide`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/optimize-roadmap-queries`)
- `test/` - Test additions or fixes (e.g., `test/add-user-profile-tests`)
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

### Keeping Your Fork Updated

```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes into your main branch
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Update your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase main
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update Documentation**: If you've changed APIs, update the relevant documentation
2. **Add Tests**: Ensure your changes are covered by tests
3. **Run All Checks**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   npm test
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add a note about your changes in the Unreleased section

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Go to the [main repository](https://github.com/yourusername/lattixiq-app) and click "New Pull Request"

3. Select your fork and branch

4. Fill out the PR template with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Related issue numbers
   - Screenshots (for UI changes)
   - Testing steps

### PR Review Process

- At least one maintainer approval is required
- All CI checks must pass
- No merge conflicts
- Up-to-date with main branch

### After Your PR is Merged

- Delete your local feature branch
- Pull the latest main branch
- Celebrate your contribution! üéâ

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes

### React Components

```typescript
// Use functional components with TypeScript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function Button({ variant, onClick, children }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      className={cn('button', variant)}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### File Organization

- One component per file
- Colocate related files (component, styles, tests)
- Use index files for clean imports

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `RoadmapCard.tsx`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `getUserProfile`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `interface UserProfile`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`)
- **Files**: kebab-case for non-components (e.g., `user-utils.ts`)

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test additions or corrections
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI configuration changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
feat(roadmap): add ability to share roadmaps with friends

# Bug fix
fix(auth): resolve Google OAuth redirect loop

# Documentation
docs(api): update roadmap endpoint examples

# Refactoring
refactor(components): extract common button styles
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% code coverage
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests** (`*.test.ts`):
   - Test individual functions and utilities
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Integration Tests** (`*.integration.test.ts`):
   - Test component interactions
   - Test API endpoints

3. **E2E Tests** (`*.e2e.test.ts`):
   - Test complete user flows
   - Run against real browser

### Writing Tests

```typescript
// Example unit test
describe("formatDate", () => {
  it("should format date in user locale", () => {
    const date = new Date("2024-01-15");
    expect(formatDate(date)).toBe("January 15, 2024");
  });
});
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change setup steps
- Document new environment variables
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Update API documentation for endpoint changes
- Create ADRs for significant architectural decisions
